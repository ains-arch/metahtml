   intro: "After 16 days of negotiations, the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Amb. Zalmay Khalilzad, tweeted that &quot;peace requires agreement on four issues: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal",
   articleHTML:"<p>After 16 days of negotiations, the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Amb. Zalmay Khalilzad,&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/US4AfghanPeace/status/1105513780375625730'>tweeted&nbsp;</a>that &quot;peace requires agreement on four issues: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, intra-Afghan dialogue, and a comprehensive ceasefire &hellip; We&rsquo;re now &lsquo;agreed in draft&rsquo; on the first two.&quot; This is a positive development, as previously the two sides had been only &quot;agreed in principle.&quot; The next step is for both sides to consult with decision-makers and seek their approval of the draft agreement so as to finalize it. This would presumably pave the way for direct talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government to address the remaining two issues.</p> <p>While there have been numerous attempts at negotiations throughout the war in Afghanistan, these talks have made by far the most progress to date. They have also engendered the most handwringing, concern, and pushback. Some of the worries surrounding these talks stem from legitimate concerns, such as the rights of women and minorities &mdash; concerns that the Taliban have occasionally sought to allay. However, the group&rsquo;s statement at the recent Moscow discussions was&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/WidaYalaqi/status/1093440130713640960'>ambiguous at best on the topic of women&rsquo;s rights</a>, which has left some to interpret it as indicative of a continued harsh stance by the group on this issue. Indeed,&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1902/26/cnr.06.html'>recent&nbsp;<em>CNN</em>&nbsp;reporting</a>&nbsp;from Taliban-held areas confirmed some of these critics&rsquo; worst fears.</p> <p>Other concerns have arisen from the fact that so far these talks have not included the government of Afghanistan, and it is clear that President Ashraf Ghani&rsquo;s administration is feeling excluded and suspicious. For example, Ghani&rsquo;s National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib recently&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-zalmay-khalilzad-trumps-envoy-to-taliban-talks-angling-to-take-over-afghanistan?via=ios'>remarked to a set of journalists</a>&nbsp;that he fears the United States is &quot;selling out&quot; Afghanistan and that Khalilzad is negotiating with intent to put himself in power as the leader of a new government. The U.S. State Department&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/afghan-adviser-refuses-u-s-demand-apologize-broadside-trump-envoy-n985176'>subsequently asked&nbsp;</a>Mohib privately to apologize for his comments, which he apparently refused to do &mdash; leading the Trump administration to cease communications with him.</p> <p>Still others are concerned that the United States is giving away too much, too early in these negotiations. For example, some have argued that Washington&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/LaurelMillerICG/status/1105540186128162816'>has squandered leverage</a>&nbsp;by agreeing to address the Taliban&rsquo;s demand of a troop withdrawal timeline prior to its engagement with the Afghan government. Or worse, that the United States is simply&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-was-ambassador-to-afghanistan-this-deal-is-a-surrender/2019/01/29/8700ed68-2409-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html?utm_term=.2ca49cd41759'>repeating its history from Vietnam</a>&nbsp;by looking for a &quot;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.amazon.com/Decent-Interval-Insiders-Indecent-Strategy/dp/0700612130'>decent interval</a>&quot; between the end of the war and the inevitable collapse of the government in Kabul.</p> <p>There are many reasons for all of these concerns &mdash; some are legitimate, stemming from real, personal fears of people likely to be directly (and perhaps repressively) affected by the results of these talks. Others stem from fears of loss of power, prestige, and/or streams of wealth that are assured to a select group that benefits from a wartime economy &mdash; a group that is not confined to the borders of Afghanistan. Still others stem from sunk cost bias, ignorance, ahistorical beliefs, and outright paranoia.</p> <p>One aspect of these talks that seems to be missing is a discussion of the continued costs of war versus the costs of peace. In other words, a dispassionate rendering of what it means for these talks to fail, versus what it might mean for them to succeed. While such discussion is inevitably fraught with challenges since there is no way to calculate such costs with absolute accuracy, let&rsquo;s nonetheless press ahead and see what we can learn.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the costs of war, and specifically the two most tangible ones &mdash; human and economic. The number of personnel from the United States and its coalition partners being killed in the war these days is relatively small (e.g., the&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://dod.defense.gov/News/Casualty-Status/'>total number</a>&nbsp;of U.S. military and Defense Department civilians killed since 2014 is 64). Much higher are the human costs among Afghans. For example, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has been&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://unama.unmissions.org/civilian-deaths-afghan-conflict-2018-highest-recorded-level-%E2%80%93-un-report'>tallying civilian casualties</a>&nbsp;of the war over the past decade. Since 2014, the number of civilians killed each year has varied slightly around an average of about 3,600. There is little reason to think that, if the war continues apace, the total for 2019 would be any less than this. In terms of Afghan security force casualties, neither the United States nor the Afghan government releases official tallies any more, but estimates of these figures can nonetheless be made. For example, projections of the&nbsp;<em>New York Times&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/afghan-war-casualty-reports'>weekly casualty data</a>&nbsp;(which it has been collecting since October of last year) suggest that we might expect at least 4,000 deaths of pro-Afghan government forces in 2019. However, there is reason to believe &mdash; based on&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47005558'>recent statements</a>&nbsp;by Ghani and&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/magazine/afghan-war-casualty-report.html?rref=collection%2Fspotlightcollection%2Fafghan-war-casualty-reports'>other Afghan government statements</a>&nbsp;&mdash; that the number could be expected to rise as high as 11,000 or more.</p> <p>The Taliban also do not release tallies of their casualties, but&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/03/13/single-ranger-battalion-deployment-racks-up-1900-terrorists-killed-or-captured-valor-awards/'>a recent press release</a>&nbsp;in the wake of a Ranger battalion deployment cited the unit&rsquo;s claim of over 1,900 Taliban killed or captured during its 4-month deployment. Let&rsquo;s assume this claim is accurate and that the vast majority of these Taliban were killed (say, 90 percent, or about 1,700). Let&rsquo;s further assume a consistent operational tempo over the next year by units that follow. This would give a rough order of magnitude estimate of about 5,000 Taliban to be killed by the U.S. counter-terrorism mission alone over the next year. If we assume that at least as many would be killed by the entire Afghan Army, police, and special operations forces, we get a very rough estimate of about 10,000 Taliban who might die over the course of the next year.</p> <p>Taking all of these estimates together, one might anticipate total deaths stemming from the war in 2019 to be in the range of 17,000 to 25,000 people. This would in effect add another 12 to 17 percent to the war&rsquo;s total number of deaths (roughly 147,000 according to Brown University&rsquo;s &quot;<a target='_blank' href='https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2018/Human%20Costs%2C%20Nov%208%202018%20CoW.pdf'>Costs of War</a>&quot; project). And none of these numbers say anything about those who would be wounded or displaced by the war, the number of which would likely total multiples of the number killed.</p> <p>In terms of economic costs, a senior Pentagon official&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-says-afghan-war-costs-taxpayers-45-billion-per-year'>publicly cited</a>&nbsp;the cost of the Afghanistan war to the United States as $45 billion last year &mdash; which includes about $5 billion for Afghanistan&rsquo;s security forces, $13 billion in operating costs for the U.S. military, $750 million in economic aid, and a host of other categories of spending such as logistics and sustainment. This does not include the costs borne by the rest of the international coalition in Afghanistan, nor by the Afghan government &mdash;&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://media.defense.gov/2018/Dec/20/2002075158/-1/-1/1/1225-REPORT-DECEMBER-2018.PDF'>which totals several billion dollars more</a>. And these are only direct costs, which fail to capture the opportunity costs to the economies of Afghanistan, the region, and all of the countries involved in the war.</p> <p>What would be the costs of peace? These are, of course, even harder to calculate, since peace remains a hypothetical scenario for Afghanistan and therefore empirical data are not available. But let&rsquo;s make an attempt. While it would be nice to assume that war casualties would go to zero, as&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/getting-ahead-of-the-implications-of-a-u-s-taliban-deal-in-afghanistan/'>I discussed previously</a>, there would likely still be a requirement for a counter-terrorism mission against the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan (whether conducted by the Americans or Afghans alone), and so it&rsquo;s likely there would still be some hundreds of deaths from that mission each year until the threat from these groups is diminished. Similarly, it would be nice to assume that costs would go to zero, but&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/getting-ahead-of-the-implications-of-a-u-s-taliban-deal-in-afghanistan/'>here again there are residual requirements</a>&nbsp;&mdash; perhaps $2 billion or more per year for continued support to Afghanistan&rsquo;s security forces, and sizeable additional amounts in continued&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://fts.unocha.org/countries/1/summary/2019'>development aid</a>, refugee resettlement programs, and programs to demobilize and reintegrate insurgent fighters.</p> <p>There are, of course, many intangible costs associated with both war and peace. For the former, these include the drag that Afghanistan has become on America&rsquo;s aims to refocus its strategic and operational attention on state adversaries such as China and Russia. For the latter, they might include some degree of the rights and freedoms that Afghan women and minorities have enjoyed for nearly the past 20 years. They might also include a degree of the power and wealth that some members of Afghanistan&rsquo;s elites have obtained as a result of the war economy.</p> <p>So what can we learn from this admittedly rough comparison of the costs of war and peace in Afghanistan? Three points come to mind. First, based on the calculations above, the continued costs of not getting to the second two issues cited by Khalilzad &mdash; intra-Afghan dialog and a comprehensive ceasefire &ndash; are sizeable, in both human terms (roughly 45 to 70 people killed every day) and economic ones (about $135 million per day in war expenditures). Anyone questioning the urgency of the negotiations should bear these figures in mind.</p> <p>Second, the costs of the war are highly bifurcated: While Washington is paying the vast majority of the financial costs, Afghans (whether aligned with the government or not) are paying the vast majority of the human ones. This is important to recognize because it helps clarify why the U.S. government is willing to meet the Taliban demand of direct talks first and intra-Afghan talks second. Such an approach allows the United States to address its costs first &mdash; to minimize its expenditures in Afghanistan (via troop withdrawal) while also minimizing the risk of another 9/11 (via a&nbsp;<em>verifiable</em>&nbsp;&quot;no safe haven&quot; guarantee by the Taliban). The sequencing of these issues is such that the Afghan-borne costs &mdash; both the current human ones and those that would accrue from a peace deal &mdash; are to be addressed second. This is clearly not lost on many Afghans and is creating a sense of hostility among the likes of Mohib for the American approach. But it&rsquo;s worth noting that this approach is consistent with both the United States&rsquo; strategic interests in Afghanistan and this administration&rsquo;s &quot;America First&quot; view of foreign policy and is therefore unlikely to change.</p> <p>Third, while reaching a peace deal would mean sizeable cost savings for the United States, the Afghan government would instead accrue significant near-term cost&nbsp;<em>increases</em>. Some of these would stem from external patrons reducing their overall contributions to Afghanistan, some from a requirement to find gainful employment for demobilized Taliban fighters and Afghan security forces, and others from the likely return of&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unhcr.org/afghanistan.html'>hundreds of thousands if not millions of refugees</a>&nbsp;from Pakistan, Iran, and elsewhere. As discussed above, there will be continued tangible costs even in a post-peace deal setting. Which means that Afghanistan&rsquo;s patrons &mdash; and especially the United States &mdash; should temper expectations of &quot;peace dividends&quot; from Afghanistan and instead be thinking of ways to help the Afghan government mitigate these costs as an insurance policy against the possibility of resurgent wartime costs in the future.</p> <p>At the same event in which Mohib questioned Khalilzad&rsquo;s motivations,&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://www.philly.com/opinion/hamdullah-mohib-afghanistan-zalmay-khalilzad-taliban-20190315.html'>he said</a>&nbsp;&quot;It is not for us [Afghans] to prescribe American national interests. What we don&rsquo;t accept is to be thrown under the bus.&quot; While it is easy to understand this kind of frustration, an examination of the costs of both war and peace make it clear that the United States is not throwing the government of Afghanistan under the bus. Rather, it is pursuing its own national interests and reduction of its own costs first, with a&nbsp;<a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/US4AfghanPeace/status/1105513781705302016'>stated intent</a>&nbsp;to address the costs to Afghans second. Rather than railing against this situation &mdash; one over which it has no control and little influence &mdash; the Afghan government would be better off preparing to expeditiously address its own interests and costs in the second phase of negotiations. Given the continued human and economic costs of the war, one can only pray that this phase will begin soon.</p><p>This article originally appeared in <a target='_blank' href='https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/weighing-the-costs-of-war-and-peace-in-afghanistan/'>War on the Rocks</a></p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>A fundamental question facing U.S. policymakers is whether North Korea intends to denuclearize. Most Pyongyang-watchers believe this is an impossibility, at least for the near term. The nuclear program has been a dream of North Korean leaders since the end of the Korean War &mdash; a deterrent against regime change from the United States, a tool to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul as part of a grand plan to unify the peninsula under North Korean rule.</p> <p>Regardless of the motive, one question is rarely asked: If Kim Jong Un wanted to denuclearize, could he?</p> <p>This question goes to the heart of U.S.-North Korea policy and the strategy of denuclearization. The assumption is that Kim, with a stroke of a pen,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-document-exclusive/exclusive-with-a-piece-of-paper-trump-called-on-kim-to-hand-over-nuclear-weapons-idUSKCN1RA2NR' target='_blank'>could give away his nuclear program</a>&nbsp;in return for economic wealth and prosperity. But the assumption that North Korea&rsquo;s supreme leader has unchecked decision-making authority is flawed, a basic misunderstanding of&nbsp;<a href='https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-koreas-power-structure' target='_blank'>how North Korea&rsquo;s system works</a>.</p> <p>Yes, Kim is the ultimate decision-maker. His authority is spelled out in the&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea' target='_blank'>Charter of the Workers&rsquo; Party</a>&nbsp;and the country&rsquo;s constitution. He holds all the titles of power: party chairman, chairman of the Central Military Commission, chairman of the State Affairs Commission, supreme commander of the armed forces. He controls the agenda and policymaking process, but can he make decisions in a vacuum and flaunt the legacy policies of his father and grandfather? Carrying out irreversible denuclearization would require just that.</p> <p>Yet, Kim&rsquo;s latitude for action is governed by forces that go beyond titles and formal power. His authority and legitimacy exists along a set of informal rules that undergird the system. These rules are tied to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/asia/kim-jong-un-family-tree-trnd/index.html' target='_blank'>the Kim family&rsquo;s role</a>&nbsp;and an unwritten contract that the supreme leader will protect and defend family equities and regime security.</p> <p>There have been times in North Korean history when the leader&rsquo;s actions encountered pushback, typically from the military. We saw this in the late 1960s when a group of former supporters of Kim Il Sung (the so-called Kapsan faction)&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapsan_Faction_Incident' target='_blank'>took issue with</a>&nbsp;his economic policies and attempts to set up his brother, Kim Yong Ju, as heir apparent. This led to a purge of many of those close to Kim Il Sung. In 1992, in another successor-inspired revolt, elements of the general staff (many educated in the Soviet Union) reportedly began to lay plans to&nbsp;<a href='https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/06/how-not-to-kill-kim-jung-un/' target='_blank'>assassinate the Kim family</a>&nbsp;during a military parade. The plot was uncovered and many officers and their families were executed.</p> <p>In 2009, Kim Jong Il had to do an about-face on a currency revaluation designed to solidify control over the economy during the succession process. This reportedly infuriated many within the high command, and the fierce pushback threatened Kim&rsquo;s plan to name&nbsp;<a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-un-life-2017-8' target='_blank'>Kim Jong Un as heir</a>. He sent his premier (Kim Yong Il) to meet with party leaders to apologize (and take responsibility) for the decision.</p> <p>In March 2010, Kim Jong Il reportedly authorized the&nbsp;<a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32013750' target='_blank'>sinking of the<em>Cheonan</em></a>&nbsp;&mdash; a South Korean naval vessel that sank in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 seamen &mdash; to curry favor with the military, which wanted revenge for a North Korean ship the South Korean navy sank months before. On more than one occasion, Kim Jong Un (like his father) has complained to visitors that he needs to be wary of the old guard and powerful institutions. After the Hanoi summit, vice foreign minister&nbsp;<a href='https://www.nknews.org/2019/03/trump-was-open-to-temporary-sanctions-relief-in-hanoi-choe-son-hui/' target='_blank'>Choe Son Hui commented</a>: &quot;Honestly, our army, people and workers and officials of the munitions industry are sending thousands of petitions to our supreme leadership not to abandon nuclear weapons at any cost.&quot;</p> <p>The notion, therefore, that Kim could act with impunity is a misinterpretation of his power and a misunderstanding of the dynamics of totalitarian regimes.</p> <p>Informal power in North Korea has to do with the legitimacy of the ruling family and the wider leadership. Legitimacy is maintained by operating within policy guidelines laid down by the leader&rsquo;s predecessors. This means that Kim Jong Un can adjust strategies, even institute new policies, as long as he adheres to the broader guidelines that dictate decision-making. He could decide to accelerate or decelerate the nuclear program, or to dismantle pieces of it, but complete, irreversible denuclearization would require first laying the foundation internally.</p> <p>Kim&rsquo;s legitimacy is based on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.38north.org/2018/11/rcarlin111318/' target='_blank'>Byungjin</a>&nbsp;&mdash; the dual development of the nuclear program and the economy. Since he has not made the economic piece of this equation work, his legitimacy (in terms of policy) rests solely on the nuclear program. To give it up without having something else in its place could erode Kim&rsquo;s personal legitimacy (tied to his bloodline).</p> <p>How would he go about laying this foundation? The process likely would begin by reaching out to key interlocutors and allies to ensure support within the old guard. He would have to secure buy-in from the Kim family, the party, military and internal security. He would need to make a cogent argument for sacrificing the nuclear program, and provide assurances that the United States and international community would follow through on any agreement.</p> <p>This would be difficult to pull off if North Korea had to agree to denuclearize on the front end; Kim could more easily agree to a phased process that shows results for sacrifices made. Viewed this way, it is not surprising that Kim balked at&nbsp;<a href='https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump'>President Trump</a>&rsquo;s &quot;<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-grand-bargain-in-hanoi-take-shape-but-can-trump-and-kim-close-the-deal/2019/02/25/dfc068c0-38c2-11e9-b786-d6abcbcd212a_story.html?utm_term=.01964a595c4f' target='_blank'>grand bargain</a>&quot; offer in Hanoi. The trust to make a deal just does not exist.</p> <p>After securing buy-in from key elements of the leadership, Kim would have to socialize the decision to invalidate guidelines set down by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. After all, his&nbsp;<a href='https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/For-Kim-Jong-Un-the-pursuit-of-nukes-is-a-family-legacy' target='_blank'>father&rsquo;s legacy</a>&nbsp;is directly tied to the nuclear program. This would mean holding party meetings across the country, and then a party congress at which Kim would announce the new policy line. Then, the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly would meet to revise the constitution&rsquo;s reference to North Korea as a &quot;nuclear-armed state.&quot;</p> <p>North Korea would broadcast this process to the world as Kim deciding to take the regime in a new direction. We have seen none of this, so it is frankly ridiculous to expect that Kim could simply decide upon denuclearization and deem it so. &nbsp;</p> <p>North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program is not for sale, although it might rent out or sideline pieces of it temporarily. In time, through phased negotiation, it might be possible for Kim and his regime to embrace unilateral denuclearization, but that will take years, if not decades. It will require a buildup of trust between North Korea and the United States, and economic benefits that pay off for North Korea&rsquo;s elite and, hopefully, the wider population.</p> <p>Only then could Kim foresee a future where he is celebrated as the father of economic reform, rather than tolerated as a third-generation despot with nuclear weapons.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href='https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/436720-can-kim-jong-un-really-denuclearize'>The Hill</a>.</p>"},

   articleHTML: "<p>The 2018 National Defense Strategy pivoted the U.S. military toward great power competition. Following that, the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act included a &quot;list of detailed and specific questions regarding the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY19%20NDAA%20Executive%20Summary%20FINAL.pdf'>roles, missions, and requirements</a> of the military services.&quot; This has brought on a reexamination of service componency and &mdash; for some &mdash; a bit of an identity crisis. The blogosphere has been active with service members from the Marine Corps, Navy Reserve, Air Force and others, questioning the mission and purpose of their organizations in the context of the NDS.</p><p>Organizations are not that different from organisms in that they will fight, first and foremost, for survival. But we should also note that survival is difficult without relevance &mdash; <a target='_blank' href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2012/01/18/how-kodak-failed/#789e5736f27a'>just ask Kodak</a>. What is most important is not what an <em>organization </em>wants its identity to be, but what its <em>customers </em>want it to be. The same is true for the military. It&rsquo;s probably no coincidence that the Navy&rsquo;s Program Objective Memorandum (POM) narrative describes &quot;The Navy the Nation Needs,&quot; and not &quot;The Navy the Navy Wants.&quot;</p><p>Our experience redesigning military organizations for shifts in missions, responsibilities and resources has offered us insights into how the services can move past these crises of identity. One way to approach the issue of service identity is to start with an understanding of a service&rsquo;s existing niches. This understanding can be developed by asking these questions:</p><ul class='custom-list-arrow'>	<li>What are the service&rsquo;s most valuable functions? The Oxford English Dictionary defines &quot;valuable&quot; as &quot;of great use or benefit&quot; &mdash; the roles, missions, and activities that are worth taxpayer dollars, as viewed by those the military serves.</li>	<li>Can or does any other service do these things? What other services provide these functions, and how broad is the overlap?</li></ul><p>This helps to describe a service&rsquo;s &quot;value propositions,&quot; the first step toward resolving the identity crisis. The value propositions of a service sit in the upper right quadrant of the chart below.</p><p><img src='/CNA_files/InDepth/ValuePropositionGraphic.png'class='img-responsive center-block' /></p><p>We can then ask, &quot;Of those propositions, which is most important?&quot; This goes beyond value &mdash; &quot;importance&quot; means &quot;carrying with it great or serious consequences.&quot; These consequences can be examined within the context of national strategy or even national survival. &nbsp;A complete mismatch between a service&rsquo;s value proposition and national strategy will certainly be cause for concern &mdash; and potentially an identity reset. But since each of the services supports a number of missions, it is more likely that matching value proposition to importance can help a service to focus its identity on the subset that is most <em>valuable, important and unique to the nation today.</em> Therein will lie its relevance.</p><p>So what is to become of those functions that are valuable and unique but not as important to national strategy today? It is important to distinguish between those functions that have lost their importance permanently and those that might be needed again as history repeats itself &mdash; or at least rhymes. Antisubmarine warfare declined in importance after the fall of the Soviet Union before roaring back with great power competition. Organizations must make a further distinction between those functions that &mdash; if lost &mdash; could be reconstituted either easily or only with great difficulty. Leaders should retain in some limited capacity those functions that are hard to reconstitute, prepared to bring them back online if they become important again in the future. The organizations that thrive are those that recognize the only permanent state of affairs is change.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>The renewed focus on great power competition is causing seismic shifts in large parts of the national security community, with the potential to reshape our understanding of strategic priorities and geopolitical relationships in regions of long-standing strategic importance. The Red Sea offers an informative case in point. The region serves as both a confirmation of the need for a comprehensive approach to great power competition and as a warning that the shift in U.S. strategic focus to Russia and China should not blind the national security community to the significance of other, major regional actors.</p><p>The Red Sea links the Suez Canal to the Gulf of Aden, making it one of the world&rsquo;s busiest waterways. It also touches on both recent and ongoing conflicts that have captured the world&rsquo;s attention, from the war in Yemen to the recent protests that overthrew the 30-year rule of Sudan&rsquo;s Omar al-Bashir. The sea&rsquo;s importance is heightened by the presence of external actors with diverse priorities, of economic choke points and military seams. The Red Sea is geographically important to the United States because of what it connects: continents, economic routes, and U.S. military combatant commands.</p><p>The shift to great power competition raises significant questions about how these dynamics will evolve over time and what they will mean for U.S. interests, particularly in the cases of China and Russia. While U.S. freedom of maneuver and access in the Red Sea does not appear to be under any imminent threat, the strategic environment in and around the Red Sea has shifted, and great power competition has forced the U.S. to consider its actions in the region, and the actions of others, through a different lens.</p>	<p>China&rsquo;s activities in and around the Red Sea are coming under increased scrutiny. Clear signs of China increasing its presence in the region are seen in its counterpiracy operations in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, military exercises with partners in the region and, most significantly, the construction of its first overseas military support facility in Djibouti in 2015. The Red Sea is important to China economically, as the ambitious Maritime Silk Road project &mdash; or Belt and Road Initiative &mdash; passes through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait that connects the sea to the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Consequently, Chinese investment around the Red Sea is likely to increase over time.</p><p>With large-scale Chinese economic investment in the region, many assume that a more robust military presence will follow. Unlike the U.S., China is positioned to capitalize on the increase in Red Sea port infrastructure required to meet the region&rsquo;s economic demands in the coming years. Chinese state-owned firms already have concessions to develop and operate terminals and other facilities at commercial ports in Egypt and Djibouti.</p><p>Investment in areas like the Red Sea suggests that China&rsquo;s has a comprehensive, integrated national strategy for its global rise, whereas the U.S. response is military- and diplomacy-focused, and lacks a clear vision of how to incorporate the informational and economic levers of power. In short, the U.S. has lost the ability to wrap economics into its strategic policy in this region, putting the U.S. at a disadvantage.</p><p>Russia plays a smaller, but nonetheless significant, role in the Red Sea. While arms sales constitute the bulk of its relationships with countries in the region, including defense deals with Egypt, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Russia&rsquo;s primary security interest is in guaranteed access to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and, perhaps, eventual basing in these areas.</p><p>Turkey, the Gulf states, and Egypt are also significant, possibly destabilizing forces in the region that are at risk of being overlooked by the U.S., given the strategic single-mindedness on competition with China and Russia. Rising tensions among Gulf States due to alleged Iranian influence and the conflict in Yemen serve as a reminder that the U.S. should not overlook the significance of major regional actors, even in an era of great power competition.</p><p>The consequences of great power competition in regions of long-standing strategic importance such as the Red Sea are still coming into focus for the national security community. In order to move forward, U.S. leadership will need to consider some important questions: What does successful competition in the Red Sea look like? How would the U.S. define success there? And finally, is competition in the Red Sea truly a zero-sum game in the paradigm of great power competition? At this inflection point, U.S. national security leaders would do well to look ahead and consider the potential costs of missed opportunities for engagement that await on the shores of the Red Sea.</p>"},

   intro: "President Trump declared the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) defeated in December 2018. But the loss of its territorial &quot;Caliphate&quot; is only part of the longer struggle. ",
   articleHTML:"<p>President Trump declared the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) defeated in December 2018. But the loss of its territorial &ldquo;Caliphate&rdquo; is only part of the longer struggle. ISIS remnants are still active in liberated areas of Iraq and Syria, and ISIS affiliates from West Africa to Southeast Asia continue operations apace. In the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, recent evidence suggests ISIS attacks are actually becoming more deadly.</p><p>In November 2017, Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi ordered his defense chief to destroy the ISIS affiliate in the country&rsquo;s Sinai Peninsula. Three months later, the Egyptian military launched Operation SINAI 2018.</p><p>ISIS-Sinai is one of the more proficient ISIS affiliates and has fought a drawn-out insurgency against Egypt &mdash; a major U.S. ally &mdash; for years. The area in which it primarily operates, the northeast corner of the Sinai Peninsula, also borders on Israel, another significant U.S. ally. For these reasons, diminishing the ISIS-Sinai threat is a U.S. national security objective.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not going well. Egypt&rsquo;s Operation SINAI 2018 continues &mdash; though that name is no longer used, so as not to remind anyone that the goal was to defeat ISIS-Sinai in three months. Halfway through 2019, ISIS-Sinai violence has been worse than in last half of 2018, and the trend continues to head in the wrong direction.</p><p>This analysis is based on ISIS&rsquo;s figures, which the group has published <a href='https://twitter.com/ZLGold/status/1017740662895251456'>since July 2018</a>. These are obviously biased numbers, but the global terrorist group&rsquo;s standardization of its weekly reporting of 1) number of attacks and 2) number of casualties makes it possible to identify trends, even if the numbers come from ISIS itself.</p><p>By its own counting, ISIS-Sinai killed or injured nearly 300 Egyptians from January to June 2019. The vast majority of these casualties are police and soldiers. A smaller number are fighters in militia the military has organized to fight the insurgents. The remainder are what ISIS calls &ldquo;spies&rdquo; or &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo;: locals who are &mdash; or at least are accused of &mdash; working with the state.</p><p>From the last quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, the number of claimed ISIS-Sinai attacks actually decreased by a quarter, from 81 to 60. But the number of alleged casualties grew to almost two-and-a-half times larger, from 80 to 196, pointing to a change in the type, target, and size of ISIS-Sinai attacks this year.</p><p>In the second half of 2018, ISIS-Sinai&rsquo;s primary method of attack was detonating roadside improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to target Egyptian security forces. In recent years, the Egyptian military has adapted to this tactic by obtaining and operating more mine-resistant vehicles. This meant that when vehicles hit IEDs, the soldiers inside were less likely to be harmed. Attacks targeting individuals were also smaller &mdash; either planned to be smaller or simply less successful. From October through December 2018, number of declared casualties (80) was less than the number of declared attacks (81).</p><p>The severity of attacks has jumped in 2019, however. From January through March, ISIS-Sinai claimed 101 casualties in 48 attacks. For example, in February the group <a href=''https://madamasr.com/en/2019/02/21/feature/politics/military-launches-raids-airstrikes-in-north-sinai-following-deadly-militant-attack-on-checkpoint/''>raided a military checkpoint</a> south of North Sinai&rsquo;s capital city, Al-Arish, attacking with explosives and gunfire before stealing weapons from the Egyptian army. ISIS-Sinai then nearly doubled its claimed casualty count to 196 in the second quarter of 2019&mdash;in just 12 more attacks than the first quarter of the year.</p><p>From April to July, ISIS-Sinai claimed a number of large attacks, usually targeting Egyptian police checkpoints or convoys. In each of the previous three quarters, the group claimed just one week with a casualty count above 20. In the second quarter of 2019, ISIS-Sinai claimed four such high-impact weeks &mdash; allegedly killing or injuring 125 Egyptians in those weeks.</p><p>In June 2019, ISIS-Sinai twice successfully attacked Egyptian police checkpoints. Perhaps more worrisome, the group claimed the slaughter of 10 construction workers, whose &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was helping the Egyptian military build security infrastructure near the airport of Al-Arish.</p><p>The uptick in large militant operations and increase in claimed attacks against Egyptian civilians bodes poorly for Sinai security. This suggests that any positive early effects of Operation SINAI 2018 were not sustained. ISIS-Sinai appears to have recovered from military pressure, and the result for the remainder of 2019 is likely to be more violence.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Changing the culture of a police organization is a complex process. It requires a forward-thinking leader with a sound strategic vision for transforming his or her organization and strong relationships with both internal and external stakeholders.</p><p>There is a saying in policing, &ldquo;Culture eats policy for breakfast.&rdquo; Changes to policy will not influence the practice unless the culture and officers who make up the department are open to change. And the best way to effect change is from the ground up. Officers must have an opportunity to provide input to changes in policy, process, strategy and training. This creates a sense of ownership among those in the field who are carrying out the leader&rsquo;s strategic vision from day to day.</p><p>Crucial to changing culture among officers are first-line and mid-level supervisors &mdash; sergeants, lieutenants and captains. Mid-level supervisors are the heart of every organization; their actions can inspire and motivate, and their inaction can create disarray and low morale. Leaders must engage first-line and mid-level supervisors as the strategic vision is developed. Their input, buy-in and ownership of the new vision for the department will ensure greater accountability and commitment to change, even beyond current leadership. Leadership in agencies like the <a href='https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/police/accountability/spd-collaborative-reform-progress-report-2018.pdf'>Spokane, WA Police Department</a> have developed internal engagement and communication strategies as a mechanism with which to engage mid-level and line officers&nbsp; in discussions about organizational changes such as revisions to policies, and training.</p><p>Equally important is the role of the community in instilling cultural change in a police organization. The community served by the agency must be part of discussions about changes to policy, training and policing strategies, especially those changes that directly affect them. The concepts of procedural justice are particularly important in engaging and gaining input from the community. Police organizations must view their communities as partners; this is especially important when implementing new technology or crime reduction strategies that will impact community members. &nbsp;Failing to engage communities early and throughout the implementation of new initiatives often leads to misperceptions about the department&rsquo;s intent and can hamper what would otherwise be successful initiatives. Recent community concerns brought forth in response to <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/tech/lapd-audit-tech/index.html'>LAPD&rsquo;s data-driving policing strategies</a> are just one example of how engaging the community about these strategies may address potential concerns and controversies.</p><p>Communities hold police agencies accountable, and a strong police-community relationship ensures that changes are understood and can be sustained. Strong community relationships that are honest and open, where the community and the police are mutually responsible for public safety, ensure a greater sense of transparency and trust. That trust is vitally important in times of crisis, most notably after a critical incident or questionable officer-involved shooting.</p><p>Waiting to engage both internal and external stakeholders &mdash; department personnel and community members&mdash;after new strategies have already been implemented and changes made will only hinder an agency&rsquo;s ability to address public safety issues. Starting at the bottom is the most effective way to successfully implement and sustain positive transformation.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Throughout 2018, CNA collaborated with University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and the World Economic Forum to conduct a series of workshops around the world. With stops in Washington, D.C.; Palo Alto, California; Hong Kong; Singapore; Moscow and Geneva, the workshop team led participants through hours of challenging scenario work. The four scenarios (you can read and watch them <a href='https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/safety-security/cyber-security-scenarios'>here</a>) allowed participants to see and react to worlds that looked very different from their own.</p><p>The workshops were fascinating, and traveling to all those amazing places was an awesome perk. However, our conclusions were both enlightening and frustrating, as each &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo; led to so many more questions. For example, workshop results convinced us that in the future, humanity doesn&rsquo;t form a global, borderless cyber nirvana, as some in Silicon Valley might once have believed. Instead, we got the sense that confronting advances in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the proliferation of data could cause countries to turn inward and become more nationalistic.</p><p>The community or country that people call home &mdash; and the nature of the government and societal norms that rule them &mdash; might dominate how people react to scientific advances and begin to cause rifts between countries where people think differently. For example, in the near future, countries will have to decide how prolifically they want access to quantum computing to spread, and different beliefs on this topic might very well cause sides or even factions to form. Or if quantum computing seems too distant of a technology, consider how the use of citizen data might cause further rifts between the governments (and even the people) of places like China and the European Union, where views are almost diametrically opposed. This should give us pause, wondering if disagreements on the &lsquo;right&rsquo; approach to developing and emerging technologies will manifest themselves more broadly than the topic alone might suggest. And, if so, shouldn&rsquo;t we be thinking about how this might play out? How might we begin to anticipate these shifts? Can we identify indicators that countries are going down one path or another early enough to help maintain relationships with our allies and advantages over our enemies?</p><p>Eeek. Heady stuff, huh?&nbsp; Not all discussion was so dark, however, which prevented the workshop team from going home and hiding under the bed. For example, we saw consensus around the idea that in a world where everyone was a &ldquo;digital citizen,&rdquo; future generations would necessarily be more savvy and better consumers of information. Great, right?&nbsp; Yes, except even this lofty idea adds to the long list of open questions. Such as: Can we figure out ways to present knowledge to this new generation in a way that could improve civil discourse? How do we prevent an educational version of the wealth gap and make sure swaths of citizens aren&rsquo;t left behind? And what needs to change in our education system to get to this new, savvy breed of human in the first place?</p><p>There are folks thinking about these questions.&nbsp; For example, consider the need for the United States to produce more savvy digital consumers. While in some places in the world (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Sweden), countries have taken on this mission, efforts have been less centralized in the United States. There are several states who have (or are in the process of) providing campaigns and education on topics ranging from identifying bots to recognizing altered images. While these efforts set my heart a-flutter, I would much prefer to see us take on these issues&mdash;and come up with solutions&mdash;at the national level.</p><p>If you are interested in the full project report &mdash; and I hope you are &mdash; you can find it <a href='/cna_files/sas/report/Cybersecurity%20Futures%202025%20Insights%20and%20Findings.pdf'>here.</a> You can also go <a href='https://cyberfutures2025.org/'>here</a> to use the tool that provides insight into where you might want to focus your time and effort in preparing for the future.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Most warships have one, permanently assigned crew. Personnel rotate on and off the ship, but a core complement remains throughout a deployment. Keeping one crew on station more than 12 months, however, often results in poor morale and a gradual deterioration of training. These conditions often require a long voyage back to the United States so that the crew can rest, take on replacements, and schedule shore-based maintenance.</p><p>The idea of rotating crews on a deployed surface warship rather than sailing it home was the subject of experimentation on small U.S. warships starting in the mid-1990s. Rotating crews allow for longer deployments and more rest and training time. Crew rotation also avoids some trans-oceanic voyages that inflict wear and tear on ships and their components.</p><p>The U.S. Navy has a mixed record of rotational crew use. Ballistic missile submarines have operated with rotational crews for decades with great success. Rotational crew employment in the smaller vessels of the U.S. surface fleet, however, has seen a mixed record of successes and challenges.</p><p>Now a number of close U.S. allies have embraced this concept. The U.K. Royal Navy, the German Navy and the French Navy have begun using rotational crews, or plan to implement the concept. Denmark has used rotational crews for some time with an overall positive effect.</p><p>Rotational crews have become increasingly common on the larger, frigate-sized ships of their fleets. <a href='https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2015/march/commanders-respond-german-navy'>The German Navy</a> is planning to use rotational crews on its F125 class frigates in order to support their presence forward for longer periods. The French Navy is purportedly planning to use rotational crews to support the overseas deployment of its FREMM frigates. <a href='https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/danish-navys-knud-rasmussen-class-patrol-ships-built-icy-greenland-waters/'>The Danish Navy</a> has used rotational crews for its ice patrol frigates for many years, and the French navy rotates crews on its <a href='https://au.ambafrance.org/On-board-L-Astrolabe-France-s-new-ship-for-Antarctic-research'>Antarctica icebreaker L&rsquo;Astrolabe.</a></p><p>The Royal Navy&rsquo;s Type 23 frigates are employing crew rotation in order to keep a ship deployed on station in the Middle East for an extended period. <a href='https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2018/october/26/181026-montrose-deploys'>HMS Montrose</a>, the Royal Navy frigate recently involved in deterring the seizure of a tanker by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, is in fact now manned by the crew of one of her sister ships, <a href='https://www.forces.net/news/navy/hms-monmouth-sailors-prepare-middle-east-deployment-hms-montrose'>HMS Monmouth</a>, currently in long-term maintenance.</p><p>Though the use of rotational crews is on the rise, allies have experienced some difficulties in their implementation, especially in periods of crisis. HMS <a href='https://www.marinelink.com/news/britain-swaps-gulf-warship-468366'>Montrose must soon come off task in order to again swap crews</a>, despite being in the midst of an active operation. The Royal Navy had to dispatch another surface combatant, HMS Duncan, to carry on Montrose&rsquo;s patrol mission.</p><p>The U.S. surface fleet has experimented with <a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Alternative-Sea-Manning-Concepts-%3A-Practices-and-Dolfini-Reed-Koopman/4d5be11e43e87f4a4edc1e8d4e6e7e9bb6077d07'>rotational crews</a> for almost a quarter century, beginning with mine warfare and patrol coastal ships. Additional experiments with simple crew swaps aboard destroyers of both the DD-963 and DDG-51 class took place in the early 2000s. The Navy has tried the Horizon system, which uses three or more crews for at least two ships, in addition to the more traditional blue/gold rotation, where one crew is on the ship while the other is training and preparing to come aboard for the next cycle. The littoral combat ship was originally designated with a 3-2-1, multi-crew <a href='https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=452783'>&ldquo;Horizon&rdquo;</a> plan but was switched to the more familiar <a href='https://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&amp;tid=1650&amp;ct=4'>blue/gold crew</a> system following a series of <a href='https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=96574'>engineering casualties</a> in 2016. The Navy also plans to use blue/gold crew rotation on the future guided missile frigate (FFGX) class.</p><p>The U.S. rotational crew experience has drawn a mixture of support and criticism. <a href='https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/559479'>Analysis by the Congressional Budget Office</a> suggested long-term costs to the Navy could be reduced as rotational crews allow for a smaller overall fleet. One critique of rotational crews, however, cites <a href='https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-17-413'>increased maintenance costs</a> for ships deployed overseas for long periods versus those based in the U.S. Other opposition seems couched in &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; and past deployment practices. Some elements of the surface Navy do not want rotational crews because it means a major cultural shift in how <a href='https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/june/good-riddance-rotational-crewshttps:/www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/june/good-riddance-rotational-crews'>sailors live and work</a> at sea and ashore. They believe sailors work best when assigned to one ship where they can develop an intimate knowledge of that vessel&rsquo;s equipment and characteristics.</p><p>Criticisms and traditions aside, the shrinking size of Western navies since the end of the Cold War and the growing list of missions for which they are responsible suggest that some method must be found to keep more ships deployed and ready for active missions for longer periods. The alternative is buying more ships and hiring more sailors. Few nations, including the U.S., seem ready to embark upon 1980s-style fleet building programs such as the <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=U.S.+Navy+Capstone+Strategies+and+Concepts+(1981-1990)&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS827US827&amp;oq=U.S.+Navy+Capstone+Strategies+and+Concepts+(1981-1990)&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61.298j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8'>600-ship Navy</a> that was intimately connected to the U.S. Navy Maritime Strategy of the Cold War era. Until such a time returns, Western navies must consider less costly solutions. For the moment, the particular solution that seems to be catching on among more navies is rotational crews.</p>"},

   intro: "There have been a number of recent, high-visibility incidents of inappropriateâand in some cases, illegalâbehavior involving Navy SEALs.",
   articleHTML:"<p>There have been a number of recent, high-visibility incidents of inappropriate&mdash;and in some cases, illegal&mdash;behavior involving Navy SEALs. In response, the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Colin Green, issued a letter to his forces in which he emphatically stated, &ldquo;We have a problem&rdquo; (emphasis in the original). He went on to say that he isn&rsquo;t yet sure whether the problem is a cultural one, but he acknowledged a lack of &ldquo;good order and discipline&rdquo; in some of his subordinate units. Others, however, have been quick to blame these incidents on a &ldquo;culture problem&rdquo; inside the SEAL enterprise. Another popular hypothesis is that the operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of SEALs&mdash;the high rate at which they deploy&mdash;is running the force ragged. Which of these explanations is correct? The answer might be &ldquo;all of them.&rdquo;</p><p>In previous CNA work, we sought to understand what factors were contributing to similar issues in another service. What we learned from those studies was that the &ldquo;culture problem&rdquo; was merely a symptom&mdash;at its heart, the problem was one of OPTEMPO.</p><p>At the height of recent wars, these forces were experiencing very high OPTEMPO. Often, units were at 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratios, meaning that they were home taking leave and training up for the next deployment for only as long as they had just been gone on deployment. Anecdotal evidence suggested that 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratios were not providing sufficient time for service members and their associated units to finish everything that they needed to do.</p><p>Anecdotes are useful to a point, but to address this issue fully, they need to be supported by analysis. We were asked to conduct a study to explore the extent to which those anecdotes reflected reality. Ultimately, we confirmed that a number of types of units had more work to do than they had time to do it&mdash;what we called constrained training time. But more eye opening were the apparent impacts of those time constraints, as well as problematic behaviors (e.g., driving under the influence and using illegal drugs) that correlated positively with the extent of time constraint.</p><p>At the first order, units that do not have enough time in dwell sacrifice counseling and mentoring behaviors first. These are the &ldquo;softest&rdquo; responsibilities, and they are in a minority of unit expectations that are not reported up the chain via some sort of readiness or completion metrics. But they are the behaviors that establish rapport between leaders and their units, and that provide checks against &ldquo;good order and discipline&rdquo; transgressions. The leaders of these units also feel forced to cut corners to make it all fit&mdash;justifying cutting corners in one domain probably makes it easier to do the same in others, including those involving decisions of ethics.</p><p>At the second order, the inability to get everything done can result in &ldquo;occupational stress.&rdquo; This kind of stress has been associated with negative coping behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse&mdash;a correlation supported in our analysis.</p><p>It is plausible that similar factors are contributing to the issues that the SEAL community has been seeing in its ranks, though counterarguments to the OPTEMPO hypothesis exist. The most notable of these stems from the observation that the special operations enterprise includes more than just SEALs. More specifically, many of the Army&rsquo;s special operations force (SOF) units have had similar OPTEMPO and deployment-to-dwell ratios as SEAL teams, and yet those units aren&rsquo;t seeing the same level of problems as Navy SOF. Those making these observations often conclude that the SEALs do, in fact, have a culture problem.</p><p>Of course, it is possible that both of these explanations are correct. It could be, for example, that the high level of OPTEMPO is creating &ldquo;good order and discipline&rdquo; problems within SEAL units and also that there is something cultural about the SEAL enterprise that is contributing to the same (e.g., perhaps the SEALs are managing their training or people in ways that are less effective than the Army at mitigating these issues).</p><p>A significant problem is that Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has not done the rigorous analysis necessary to fully understand what&rsquo;s happening. While Congress mandated that SOCOM should conduct an internal &ldquo;ethics and professionalism&rdquo; review via last year&rsquo;s National Defense Authorization Act, the result of that effort was submitted to Congress in March and not made public. When recently asked about that, a SOCOM spokesperson admitted, &ldquo;while the command is doing a number of ongoing assessments to assess the impacts of the war on terror, &ldquo;there is not an overarching study.&rdquo;&rdquo; To be fair, the need for such a study has been recognized by SOCOM&mdash;the command&rsquo;s Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) included in its Special Operations Research Topics 2020 document a &ldquo;SOF ethos and ethics&rdquo; topic, which asks for research on whether the current spate of incidents represents a force-wide problem. However, JSOU&rsquo;s publication is a wish list of study ideas. What is lacking is any actual study of these issues by SOCOM and the SOF enterprise in a rigorous and comprehensive way.</p><p>All of which is to say, it is easy to blame leaders, or culture, or the ethics of the force, or the stresses being put on our elite operators by years of repeat deployments, for the rash of issues we&rsquo;re seeing today. But what&rsquo;s really missing is the type of analysis that we have done previously&mdash;an empirical study to disentangle these hypotheses and provide SOCOM&mdash;and the SEAL enterprise especially&mdash;the insights it needs to effectively address these issues. Until such a study is completed, the answer to what is driving these incidents will remain elusive.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>The Indo-Pacific was not a factor when the two superpowers involved in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty negotiated the treaty. But the demise the U.S.-Russia pact on August 1 could have serious consequences in the region, ranging from an arms race to innovative disarmament treaties. U.S. national security planners have new options to consider in Indo-Pacific, as well as new challenges that will require careful consideration.</p><p>These were the issues that brought together treaty allies, U.S. government officials, national security experts and academics on July 23 and 24 for a workshop by the Center for Global Security Research. They convened to understand the security implications for the Indo-Pacific of different courses of action in a post-INF Treaty world.</p><p>After years of allegations that Russia was violating the treaty, the U.S. formally withdrew on August 1, 2019. <a href='https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-03-04/mourning-inf-treaty' aria-invalid='true'>The INF Treaty</a> was a landmark arms control agreement negotiated between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that indefinitely prohibited the possessing, testing or deployment of ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles with range capabilities between 500 and 5,000 kilometers. The U.S. decision to withdrawal from the treaty has been divisive, not only for the parties involved &mdash; the U.S. and Russia &mdash; but also for U.S. partners and allies, including those in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>One argument advocating for U.S. withdrawal centered on China&rsquo;s arsenal of INF-range ground-based missiles capable of preventing the U.S. military from operating in the Indo-Pacific. According to the <a href='https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/China%20and%20INF_0.pdf' aria-invalid='true'>U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission</a>, the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army Rocket Force &ldquo;has at least 1,330 and potentially more than 1,895 ballistic and cruise missiles, which includes 1,000&ndash;1,200 short-range ballistic missiles, 75&ndash;100 medium-range ballistic missiles, 5&ndash;20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, 50&ndash;75 intercontinental ballistic missiles, and 200&ndash;500 ground-launched land-attack cruise missiles.&rdquo; Approximately 90 percent of China&rsquo;s ballistic and cruise missile inventory falls within the ranges prohibited by the INF Treaty.</p><p><a href='https://thediplomat.com/2019/02/china-wont-join-the-inf-treaty-but-can-it-forever-dodge-arms-control/'>These scores of missiles</a> can hold at risk U.S. bases in Japan, as well as Anderson Air Force base in Guam. U.S. officials &mdash; notably the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Adm. Harry Harris &mdash; have argued that the <a href='https://news.usni.org/2017/04/27/pacom-u-s-should-renegotiate-inf-treaty-that-limits-conventional-mid-range-missiles'>INF treaty constrained the U.S.</a> because China is not party to it, and it is necessary for the U.S. to deploy conventional ground-based, intermediate-range missile systems (GBIRs) to counter China&rsquo;s growing anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities. However, there are two significant political challenges associated with deploying GBIRs that the U.S. will have to address.</p><p>One challenge is the potential escalation of aggression. Authoritative Chinese media have repeatedly stated that the <a href='https://carnegietsinghua.org/2018/11/07/why-china-is-worried-about-end-of-inf-treaty-pub-77669' aria-invalid='true'>U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty</a> could spur a new arms race. Tong Zhao, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, stated, &ldquo;It is highly likely that China would try to counter new U.S. capabilities by doubling down on its own investments in similar technologies and other countermeasures. A broader arms competition that spills over into additional technological domains other than traditional ballistic and cruise missiles seems hard to avoid.&rdquo; One proposed solution is to negotiate an arms control treaty that includes China. Given China&rsquo;s current nuclear force modernization and rising global status, this theory has merit. But it is highly unlikely that China would join a treaty similar to the INF, which would constrain the majority of their arsenal. <a href='https://thediplomat.com/2019/05/in-a-post-inf-treaty-world-the-united-states-must-consider-its-basing-options-in-asia/'>Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi</a> explicitly stated, &ldquo;We are opposed to the multilateralization of the INF.&rdquo; However, there is always a possibility China might join a different type of treaty.</p><p>Another political challenge in a post-INF Treaty world is the placement of U.S. ground-based, intermediate range missiles in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from Guam, which is a U.S. territory, the most likely candidates are Japan and South Korea. <a href='https://www.yahoo.com/news/australia-rules-hosting-us-missiles-050947886.html'>Australia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Scott Morrison</a> has already announced that Australia will not host U.S. GBIRs. Each of these countries presents different receptivity, challenges and costs associated with hosting U.S. missiles. Due to the <a href='https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/31/leaving-inf-treaty-won-t-help-trump-counter-china-pub-78262' aria-invalid='true'>immense risk in a conflict scenario</a>, any ally agreeing to host these systems may also insist on having a say in their operational control and use. Additionally, each country has its own domestic politics and national security concerns to consider. U.S. planners will need to engage in considerable consultation and coordination with partners and allies before moving forward.</p><p>Before producing new ground-based intermediate range systems, the U.S. should consider all of the nuances and risks associated with their deployment. The end of the INF treaty creates new challenges that the U.S. will have to address thoughtfully. A replay of an INF-style treaty may not be an option. Perhaps this new environment will require a new form of arms control agreement.</p>"

   intro: "The National Security Commission on AI solicits creative and original ideas to challenge the status quo assumptions on maintaining US global leadership in AI"/*,
   articleHTML:"<p>Barely more than a decade has passed since Bitcoin was invented, but cryptocurrencies have pervaded American culture and language. In 2018 nearly <a href='https://www.coindesk.com/survey-nearly-80-of-americans-have-heard-of-bitcoin'>80 percent of Americans</a> reported having heard of the cryptocurrency. Talk of cryptocurrencies seems to be everywhere <a href='https://breakermag.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-crypto-references-in-pop-culture'>in popular culture</a>: &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; &ldquo;Family Guy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Big Bang Theory,&rdquo; several episodes of &ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s just the television shows. The word &ldquo;cryptocurrency&rdquo; even made it to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2018.</p><p>Surprisingly, though, most people are still unsure how the technology works, and many myths about its pros and cons persist. Based on recent <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/CRM-2019-U-020186-Final.pdf'>CNA analysis</a>, we would like to debunk five myths about cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Myth 1. You need a computer science degree to become a user. As one analyst thoughtfully argued, cryptocurrencies are the microwave ovens of the 21st century. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that microwaves represented an incredible innovation; very few people understood how they worked, and many expressed apprehension about putting them in home kitchens. Yet today microwaves are everywhere, despite the fact that most people still don&rsquo;t know how the technology works. People adopted microwaves because they became common and familiar, not because they became easier to understand. Cryptocurrencies are similar. Understanding the technology isn&rsquo;t necessary for the average person to use this new form of money.</p><p>Myth 2: Cryptocurrencies are anonymous. Cryptocurrencies are actually pseudonymous; there is a difference. The idea of Bitcoin originated with a loosely affiliated group known as <a href='https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html'>Cypherpunks</a>, who wanted to use cryptography as a means to increase privacy. They were worried that the governments and banks behind conventional currencies like the U.S. dollar had no incentive to guarantee the privacy of users. <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/we-need-to-know-who-satoshi-nakamoto-is'>Their solution</a> was to create a global financial system that excluded governments and banks. This would seem to allow for <a href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-anonymous/'>the anonymous movement of money</a>. But holders of cryptocurrencies are known by their public keys, much as an author might be known by a pseudonym. As a result, if a user&rsquo;s true identity is ever linked to her public key, it would be <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07501.pdf'>possible to trace all of her activity</a>, in the same way that if an author&rsquo;s pen name is ever linked to her real name, all of the books she wrote under the pseudonym would be linked to her true identity</p><p>Myth 3: Terrorist organizations are dependent on cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are popular among criminals engaged in <a href='https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA01/20180620/108476/HHRG-115-BA01-Wstate-NevanoG-'>a wide variety of illegal activities</a> ranging from financial crimes like money laundering to more traditional crimes such as purchasing illegal goods. And of course cryptocurrencies are well-suited to cybercrimes involving ransomware. But despite the many articles that have been written on terrorism and cryptocurrency, most terrorist activity in this space has been modest, with organizations raising relatively small amounts of money. That said, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/technology/terrorists-bitcoin.html'>some analysis</a> suggests that this is the future of terrorism finance, and that terrorists are moving in this direction.</p><p>Myth 4: The blockchain is immutable. Cryptocurrency advocates often argue that the immutability of the blockchain &mdash; the ledger that records all transactions &mdash; is one of the most valuable qualities of the technology. The reality, though, is that the blockchain can be edited by any individual or group that controls enough of the network. This is called a <a href='https://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/papers/cryptorisks.pdf'>51% attack.</a> In at least one case, a blockchain was <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp'>edited by criminals</a> to steal money. In other cases, it has been edited by <a href='http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/cacm244.pdf'>well-meaning developers</a> trying to stop criminals from stealing money.</p><p>Myth 5: Cryptocurrencies are a trustless system. Cryptocurrencies were created in part to allow people to exchange money without having to trust an external authority like a bank. In practice, though, cryptocurrencies still require trust. A transaction passed through a bank and recorded in the bank&rsquo;s centralized ledger requires trust that the bank will be honest. A transaction in cryptocurrencies recorded in the blockchain trusts that the developers and miners &mdash; who might control majorities of the network &mdash; will be honest.</p><p>To learn more, follow these links to the full reports: <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/CRM-2019-U-020185-Final.pdf'>Cryptocurrencies: A Primer for Policy-Makers</a> and <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/CRM-2019-U-020186-Final.pdf'>Cryptocurrencies: Implications for Special Operations Forces</a>.</p>"*/

   articleHTML:"<p>Ingrid.&nbsp; Sandy. Irene, Erika. Irma. Florence, Maria. Katrina. And now Dorian! Just the mention of these names might trigger fear and anxiety in some living in North America. That is because listed are the names of hard-hitting hurricanes that have created havoc in hundreds of communities over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted about nine to15 named storms to form during the 2019 Atlantic Hurricane Season, including four to eight hurricanes and two to four &ldquo;major&rdquo; hurricanes&ndash;storms that reach Category 3 to Category 5.</p><p>So what can be done to prepare? &nbsp;According to CNA hurricane experts, emergency management officials can avoid the costly and sometimes tragic mistakes of the past by following these tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Plan for internet outages.</strong> Millions of Floridians lost their internet after Hurricane Irma, yet local emergency managers rely heavily on social media and other internet applications for critical communications. Planning, training and equipment for backup communications have to be addressed in advance.</li><li><strong>Coordinate electric utility and road clearance teams.</strong> CNA after-action analysis of Hurricane Irma found that Road Clearing Task Forces facilitated power restoration and road clearing. Where the utility and road crews worked separately, utility crews were often blocked by fallen trees and road crews couldn&rsquo;t work where downed lines created the risk of electrocution.</li><li><strong>Get ready to track evacuees in shelters.</strong> In the past, some home health agencies couldn&rsquo;t find their evacuated clients; fire departments wasted precious time searching for citizens who signed up for transportation assistance. Concerned relatives couldn&rsquo;t get information about who was in what shelter. Technological solutions to track people&mdash;and pets&mdash;in shelters require advance planning.</li><li><strong>Have a back-to-school plan.</strong> Schools are often used as shelters, but sometimes the school is ready to reopen when evacuees still are unable to safely return home. Local governments should consider locations other than schools for some shelters, especially for residents who may have to stay longer because they have access or functional needs.</li><li><strong>Sit down with private sector suppliers of key commodities.</strong> Governments simply can&rsquo;t provide everything that&rsquo;s required in the aftermath of a disaster. Grocery warehouses often store more than enough food for emergency supplies, but without advanced planning food could be trapped inside distribution centers during an emergency. After Hurricane Irma desperately needed medical supplies and equipment sat unused in local warehouses.</li><li><strong>Prepare 9-1-1 for hurricane info calls.</strong> It&rsquo;s important to get the message out that 9-1-1 is only for emergency assistance&mdash;but experience from previous hurricanes tells us many ignore the advice. If 9-1-1 call centers are prepared with hurricane talking points or an effective way to reroute information calls, they can quickly provide help and get back to their essential duties.</li><li><strong>Review Plans to Shelter Residents with Disabilities and Access and Functional Needs.</strong> In one hurricane jurisdiction, CNA found that only 10 percent of evacuees requiring assistance had pre-registered. Sheltering those with access and functional needs requires extra planning to ensure adequate supplies and care while avoiding overburdened hospitals.</li><li><strong>Prepare separate evacuation plans for critical businesses.</strong> CNA analysts have found some gas stations and grocery store managers think residential evacuation orders apply to them, resulting in some panic for evacuees who needed to fill up and stock up. Planners need to create and communicate designated windows of evacuation.</li><li><strong>Keep your cool.</strong> When 14 nursing home residents died because their air conditioning failed during Hurricane Irma, we saw the urgency of planning to prevent deaths from overheating. CNA has found that mobile cooling stations are one effective option to bring relief to facilities that have no AC. And, planners will need contingency plans for facilities where &ldquo;generator power&rdquo; is only enough to keep the lights on.</li><li><strong>Make sure you won&rsquo;t be dumped by debris removal contractors.</strong> During past hurricane seasons, many jurisdictions learned the hard way that debris removal companies go where the money is&mdash;even if a contract is in place. Local leaders should review debris collection contracts and identify competing contracts with cities and neighboring jurisdictions.</li></ol><p>To learn more about CNA&rsquo;s hurricane research and after-action reports visit CNA.org.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>As my former boss at the Federal Emergency Management Agency used to say, the beginning of college football season brings the &quot;real&quot; start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Weather Service tells us that the annual hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, but those in the emergency management profession are well aware that August, September and October usually bring the most dangerous storms towards our shores.</p><p>Although we seem to have avoided the worst of Hurricane Dorian&rsquo;s wrath &mdash; unlike the Bahamas, where at least 30 persons have been killed and over 13,000 homes were destroyed &mdash; the storm&rsquo;s impacts in North Carolina clearly demonstrate that Dorian was one of the most powerful and destructive hurricanes that we have ever experienced. Moreover, since August 24, when Dorian reached tropical storm strength, this storm has severely tested both the nation&rsquo;s hurricane forecasting capabilities and our disaster response infrastructure.</p><p>On the positive side, despite the uncertainties about where the storm might make landfall on the continental U.S., millions of citizens in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina took appropriate, early action to evacuate their homes and seek shelter. For several days, it was well within the realm of possibility that Dorian would strike the east coast of Florida as a major hurricane, causing significant destruction of property and threating the lives of any residents who remained behind. When one weighs the relatively small inconvenience of evacuating for 48 hours versus risking the lives of yourself and your loved ones, the decision to evacuate should be an easy one. It is apparent that the lessons of Katrina, Harvey, Irma, Maria, and countless other storms have made a lasting impact on the behavior of individual citizens; we are taking responsibility for our own safety, and ensuring that we act appropriately in the face of real threats. This is an achievement that we can be proud of as a nation, and it will save many lives in the years to come.</p><p>With respect to the emergency management professionals, we can and will do better to help individual citizens protect themselves. Through continuing research and analysis, we at CNA are working to refine preparedness and response operations in three important ways. We are helping governments to identify the most vulnerable populations, and working to reduce their vulnerability. We are finding ways to access, analyze and display the information that is most useful to the government and the public to help them make key decisions. And we are forecasting the response problems that are &quot;around the corner,&quot; and testing our hypotheses by examining the successes and areas for improvement in prior response operations.</p><p>As the 2019 hurricane season continues, we will watch more storms develop off the coast of Africa and will exercise our ever-improving ability to forecast their path, strength and potential impacts. With sustained and enhanced cooperation between government officials, the private sector, voluntary agencies and the public, we can continue to reduce suffering and better protect the nation from these inevitable events.</p>"},

In that report, we recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) begin collecting data to identify those joining the military who were using e-cigarettes, since little was known about both the short and long-term health effects of these products. At that time, about 10 percent of youth were using e-cigarettes. Since the study&rsquo;s publication, youth e-cigarette use has doubled to over <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/youth-tobacco-use/index.html'>20 percent</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, DOD did not begin collecting data on recruit e-cigarette use at the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS).

In addition, the responses are confidential and cannot be tied back to individual health records, and 2015 is the most recent available data from that survey.</p><p>There is no time like the present for DOD to be concerned about the growing trend in youth e-cigarette use. Based on the recent unexplained medical emergencies associated with e-cigarettes, we continue to urge DOD to collect information on the e-cigarette use by servicemembers and recruits. That way, DOD will know more about the population at risk for these illnesses and will be better prepared to assess whether it should create policies on e-cigarette use for both new recruits and current servicemembers. Our work also hypothesized that e-cigarettes can be a gateway drug to marijuana use, which can be a disqualifier for military service. As the risks of e-cigarette use become clearer, more data on military e-cigarette use will enable DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs to better prepare for the costs those risks impose on military recruits, servicemembers, and our nation.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>&ldquo;Staggering.&rdquo; &ldquo;Horrific.&rdquo; &ldquo;Unbearable.&rdquo; These are words used by the United Nations to describe the latest tragic airstrike in Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition, which hit a facility in Dhamar used as a prison. A hundred or more detainees died, according to estimates, despite their protections under international law. Unfortunately, this strike is just the latest tragedy in the four-year campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, crippled hospitals and infrastructure, and helped create the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p>While the United States is not fighting in the war, it has supported the coalition with intelligence, fighter jets, fuel and many of the bombs that are contributing to the civilian suffering in Yemen. The United States&rsquo; involvement in the Yemen conflict has not only caused serious damage to its reputation but also harmed its strategic interests by allowing Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to solidify its grasp on territory while increasing support for terrorist acts against the U.S. and its interests. Congress has questioned whether U.S. assistance complies with existing laws, and the U.N. recently warned the U.S. that its support may constitute war crimes. While U.S. government legal analysis concludes that its support to the coalition is legal, the situation is described well by Harold Koh&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;lawful but awful.&rdquo;</p><p>This awful aspect of U.S. assistance in Yemen points back to a fundamental problem: although the U.S. is the world&rsquo;s largest dealer in arms, it does not have a policy addressing civilian protection challenges when a recipient of military assistance uses force. A research report from CNA, Promoting Civilian Protection during Security Assistance: Learning from Yemen, finds that the tragedy of Yemen offers lessons on urgently needed policies to integrate civilian protection into U.S. security assistance.</p><p>A Security Assistance Policy in Crisis. Without an overarching policy to guide decision-making regarding Yemen, U.S. actions were influenced by distinct, sometimes opposing, agencies and interests. The White House, State Department, Department of Defense and U.S. Agency for International Development each implemented U.S. security assistance policy toward the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Multiple U.S. goals &mdash; supporting Saudi Arabia, promoting peace, providing humanitarian aid, reducing civilian casualties &mdash; tended to be promoted in isolation, impacting the effectiveness of civilian protection activities and reducing unity of effort. CNA&rsquo;s analysis suggests that an overall strategy promoting effective and responsible use of U.S. assistance, including the possibility of curtailing operational support and continuing mentoring to promote responsible behavior, would have been a better approach.</p><p>Decision-Making in the Dark. Efforts to collect data on civilian casualties in Yemen and to reconstruct and analyze incidents were limited and ad hoc. The lack of an established assessment process regarding operational use of security assistance in Yemen hobbled the policy decision-making process. Similar CNA analysis of more successful data collection efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria shows the value of tracking and analyzing civilian casualties in order to reduce the risk to civilians. Integrating civilian protection into security assistance requires an evidence-based approach, referencing multiple sources of information, both military and open-source data, regarding how assistance partners are using U.S.-supplied weapons systems and the results on the ground.</p><p>Protection of health care in Yemen. The destruction of medical facilities is particularly devastating, both immediately and the long term. They cause casualties of patients seeking care; they also harm scarce medical personnel and destroy medical infrastructure, sorely needed in war. And strikes on hospitals make the population less willing to seek needed medical care in the future. These effects were all seen in Yemen, with the Saudi-led coalition damaging or destroying many medical facilities. Analysis of attacks against medical facilities in Yemen indicates that they were not struck deliberately with premeditated intent. Still, our analyses of attacks on civilian objects including health care facilities in this and other conflicts provide practical steps militaries can take to better protect medical facilities from inadvertent attacks. Many of these practices can also help avoid tragic strikes on other protected sites, such as prison facilities destroyed in the Dhamar strike.</p><p>While some have called for the end of U.S. assistance to partners in the Saudi-led coalition, the fact remains that the U.S. has strategic interests in working with these partners. But this assistance does not need to result in awful results.

   articleHTML:"<p>Reading the news reports and seeing the images of the destruction in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, I am reminded of our work in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricane Maria. When an island community faces such catastrophic damage, efforts to help and rebuild are difficult and slow. The first impulse is to send immediate aid in the form of food, water and other lifesaving commodities. In the initial days that is essential, but what we have learned in Puerto Rico is that when the damage is on a catastrophic scale &mdash; as is now the case in the Bahamas &mdash; no government can meet the needs of an entire island&rsquo;s population. The private sector is key to recovery.</p><p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, the devastation in Puerto Rico was shocking and pleas for help were ubiquitous in news coverage. As a result, the U.S. government launched the largest food mission in U.S. history. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was able to provide more than 30 million meals to the Puerto Rican government during the first 6 months to an island of 3.4 million people. Despite the massive mission, the relief effort amounted to only nine meals per person over six months.</p><p>Yet at the same time, the island&rsquo;s grocers were open within days of landfall and even reported the largest volume of food sales since 2009. In fact, within four weeks of landfall, over 90 percent of residents were fulfilling fundamental needs through the capacity of preexisting private sector supply chains or ad-hoc replacements. Not realizing that, FEMA continued to focus on delivering food and water, inadvertently blocking the efforts of the private sector to recover quickly by taking up limited trucking resources, vessel capacity and dock space at the ports needed for distribution. [See <a href='/research/hurricane-supply-chain'>https://www.cna.org/research/hurricane-supply-chain</a>]</p><p>Based on our assessment of the U.S. government&rsquo;s experience in Puerto Rico, the Bahamian government should focus as soon as possible on helping private sector supply chains recover. By focusing effort on reestablishing power and communications, providing access to fuel and clearing roads, the government can support the essential infrastructure for the private sector supply chains to flow. This will speed up the island&rsquo;s recovery.</p><p>Restoring power and communications will allow stores to open and process sales. In the interim, the government can assist the private sector by providing novel solutions like setting up temporary mobile electronic data transfer connections to help process bankcards to enable payment for goods. Early in Puerto Rico&rsquo;s recovery, lack of such electronic access was often the only thing standing between food and hungry people.</p><p>Delivery trucks will distribute goods where they are needed as long as they have fuel and clear roads. The Bahamian government should make those tasks a priority. The government can further facilitate the distribution of goods by ensuring that the island&rsquo;s distribution centers have access to their trucks and drivers and that their goods make it into the ports. Government and charitable relief efforts, while understandably large, should not be allowed to consume all of the available distribution resources such as port space or permitted truck drivers.</p><p>This level of coordination between the government and private sector requires trust and open discussions about resources. This will allow the two parties to work together to quickly identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and solve them. Ultimately, it is the private sector supply chain that will meet the needs of the population.</p>"},

Both bases reside in territory held by U.S. allies; Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Diego Garcia is the largest island in the British Indian Ocean Territory. The status of either or both bases could change. Earlier this year, the International Court of Justice issued an <a href='https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12146.doc.htm'>advisory opinion</a> that Britain should cede Diego Garcia and the rest of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Full independence from Denmark is a central <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/greenland-eyes-independence-from-denmark-after-election-vote.html'>political issue in Greenland</a>.</p><p>Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia and Thule Air Base remain incredibly valuable to U.S. interests. Diego Garcia&rsquo;s central location in the Indian Ocean will continue to be a vital site for the United States&rsquo; ability to conduct operations in the Indian Ocean, especially as China increases its activities here. In the case of Thule, the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. gap is a vital strategic choke point. Russia&rsquo;s submarine-launched cruise missiles and the importance of transatlantic seafloor cables give Russian submarines real reasons to try to slip into the Atlantic &mdash; and give the U.S. and its allies compelling reasons to maintain bases in both Iceland and Greenland for antisubmarine aircraft patrols.</p><p>Engaging with local populations and acknowledging their sovereignty ambitions can help ensure continued access to these critical bases. The U.S. should speak directly with the governing bodies in Greenland and Mauritius and demonstrate the economic value of these bases to local populations.</p><p>Supporting the international rule of law &mdash; even when it goes against allies and complicates U.S. basing imperatives &mdash; has an additional benefit. The U.S. will increase its own credibility around other international legal disputes. For instance, the U.S. has been <a href='https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-recognizes-the-united-kingdoms-continued-sovereignty-over-the-british-indian-ocean-territory/'>taking issue</a> with the use of the International Court of Justice in the dispute between Mauritius and the U.K. over the Chagos Islands. But this appears to be in tension with the U.S. <a href='https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/07/259587.htm'>endorsement of using the Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> to evaluate the Philippines&rsquo; dispute with China&rsquo;s claims in the South China Sea.</p><p>Greenland and Diego Garcia are key enablers of U.S. military missions. Washington will need to balance the strategic and operational advantages gained from such access with its diplomatic and legal commitments to uphold international law and norms. Engagement with local populations and demonstrated economic benefits for the host countries could help ensure U.S. basing rights in these vital locations.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>The tragic news that three sailors took their own lives on the USS George H.W. Bush in September has caused me to reflect on CNA&rsquo;s role in helping the Department of the Navy prevent suicides. Since 2010, we have analyzed Navy and Marine Corps administrative databases, performed a big data pilot on an assortment of destructive behaviors related to suicide, and completed a literature review of prevention best practices. These analyses have been valuable in themselves, but also have informed our development of suicide-prevention training tools.</p><p>Many studies of suicide risk factors have been impaired by a tendency to look at commonalities among suicide victims, without comparing them to the general population. Identifying common traits among victims fails to take into account the fact that those traits may be equally prevalent in the unstudied population that did not commit suicide. The more difficult &mdash; and more valid &mdash; analytical approach is to determine the differences between victims and the general Navy/Marine Corps population.</p><p>My colleagues Diana Lien and Laura Kelly took the more valid approach, analyzing Navy and Marine Corps databases from 2001 to 2012, piecing together information from several personnel and deployment-related sources. They found that certain groups of sailors and marines have a risk of suicide several times greater than the population at large, such as those in certain communities and at particular stages in their careers. This work pinpointed the critical need to focus special attention on high-risk groups. The analysis indirectly led to changes in policy.</p><p>More recently, CNA&rsquo;s Peggy Golfin built on Lien&rsquo;s foundation, assembling some 22 Navy datasets of medical, training, and destructive-behavior records and applying special big data methods to them. Analyzing portions of the data, Golfin discovered the importance of previous destructive behaviors as a common factor associated with further destructive behaviors, including suicide. She made recommendations for using that insight to reduce destructive behaviors. Now that the dataset has been assembled and demonstrated, the Navy has a new tool for pursuing many more suicide-related analyses to inform policy and programming, commanders and counselors.</p><p>Our analytical work has also informed the development of two board games designed to help command leadership identify warnings and indicators of destructive behaviors and to respond appropriately, while still achieving ship readiness and combat effectiveness.</p><p>No single tool or piece of analysis will magically solve the serious problem of suicide that is vexing the military community. Much hard work lies ahead, both in further analysis and in the implementation of insights, best practices and lessons learned. But these steps point toward a better future for the health of the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Australia plays a critical role in maintaining strategic stability in the Indian Ocean and remains one of the United States&rsquo; closest allies on economic, diplomatic, defence, and intelligence matters. Canberra has been a thought leader in formulating the &ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo; concept. Yet, even with the shift in US policy focus from the Asia-Pacific to the Indo-Pacific, US regional priorities will remain firmly entrenched in the Western Pacific. As a result, Washington needs Australia to be a leader in strategic thinking on how to approach the management of the Indian Ocean region.</p><p><strong>US conception of the Indo-Pacific</strong></p><p>Within the first year of the Trump administration, the &ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo; phrase entered US policy documents through the December 2017 National Security Strategy, which discussed the importance for US interests of keeping this region &ldquo;free and open.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo; was subsequently referenced in the January 2018 Summary of the US National Defense Strategy. In May 2018, US Pacific Command was renamed Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM).</p><p>US priorities remain mostly the same in the Indian Ocean, despite a broader regional focus. The geographic responsibilities for INDOPACOM, for example, have not changed, and its area of responsibility still excludes the western half of the Indian Ocean. This aligns with the conception of the Indo-Pacific in the National Security Strategy, defines the region as stretching &ldquo;from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States.&rdquo; Consequently, the Indian Ocean remains segmented in US diplomatic and defence bureaucracy and secondary to US priorities in the Western Pacific and the Middle East.</p><p>However, this unchanged state of administrative planning does not mean that Washington will withdraw from the Indian Ocean, as feared by some regional observers recalling the United Kingdom&rsquo;s actions 50 years ago. Multiple factors make clear that no &ldquo;East of Suez&rdquo; departure looms for US presence in the Indian Ocean anytime soon.</p><p>Despite former president Barack Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;rebalance&rdquo; to Asia and the return to great-power competition under the Trump administration, Washington continues to devote significant foreign policy attention to the Middle East and must manage threats to freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz. Bahrain provides a key base for naval operations in the Western Indian Ocean. The base at Diego Garcia is central to US logistical support in the Indian Ocean. The United States&rsquo; affirmation of UK sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, despite the growing success of Mauritius&rsquo; legal and diplomatic campaign, illustrates continued US determination to maintain a presence in the Indian Ocean.</p><p><strong>Australia&rsquo;s contributions to US goals in the Indian Ocean</strong></p><p>The Australian continent is situated between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which gives the country a direct stake in both regions. As a result, Canberra&rsquo;s diplomatic, legal, and military approaches to management of the Indian Ocean part of the Indo-Pacific region will continue to be vital for US interests. There are three clear examples.</p><p>One is Australia&rsquo;s support for US interpretations of international law. In particular: Australia&rsquo;s rejection of the May 2019 UN General Assembly resolution endorsing the International Court of Justice&rsquo;s advisory opinion on the need for the UK to leave the Chagos Islands. Many US allies, such as France and Germany, abstained on this resolution, and the vote at the UN was overwhelmingly against the UK: 116 in favour, while only six were opposed. Australia&rsquo;s vote against the resolution was welcomed by US policymakers seeking to maintain the United States&rsquo; presence in this vital location in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Second, Australia&rsquo;s military operations in the Indian Ocean advance US goals to ensure regional stability. In the western Indian Ocean, Australia is a member of Combined Maritime Forces, having both participated in and commanded the counterpiracy and counterterrorism task forces. Canberra lent crucial support to Washington by agreeing to contribute to a new mission to ensure safe passage of merchant vessels in the Strait of Hormuz &shy;&ndash; one of the few US allies that publicly declared its willingness to back this operation.</p><p>Finally, Australia has used its prominent roles to advance regional institutions such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) &ndash; chairing the renamed organization in 2013&ndash;14 and drawing attention to illegal fishing in the Perth Communiqu&eacute; &ndash; and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), chairing it in 2014&ndash;15 and finalising the IONS Charter. The US understands the limits of its standing in each of these institutions (being only a dialogue partner in IORA, and not having even observer status in IONS). Consequently, Australia&rsquo;s role in participating in regional architecture is critical for promoting the US vision of a free and open region.</p><p><strong>The years ahead</strong></p><p>The US will continue to rely on its treaty alliance with Australia for assistance in maintaining regional stability. Beyond Australia&rsquo;s role in sharing the US interpretation of international law in the South China Sea and support for military operations in the Middle East, its diplomatic and military activities are important for laying the foundation of Indian Ocean security and advancing norms for an open international order in the coming decades.</p><p>An emerging issue is in Antarctica, where Australia is playing an active role in conceptualising upcoming security issues in the nearby Southern Ocean, especially with regard to increasing Chinese equities.</p><p>Australia continuing to play this strategic role in areas outside the Western Pacific advances US goals for stability in the Indian Ocean and beyond.</p><p>This piece was produced as part of a two-year project being undertaken by the National Security College on the Indian Ocean, with the support of the Department of Defence.

Diplomatic recognition of Taiwan is a source of irritation in Beijing, and eliminating any recognition of Taiwan is viewed as positive support for the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s objective of defending national sovereignty. Since high-profile events <a href='https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-protests-in-hong-kong/id1198761728?i=1000448021520'>such as protests in Hong Kong</a> are currently creating serious challenges for China, diplomatic wins &mdash; even relatively minor success like those in the Pacific &mdash; take on extra significance.</p><p>For Taiwan, the fact that only 15 countries now formally recognize the island is disappointing but does not fundamentally change Taiwan&rsquo;s precarious position. Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen used the Solomon Islands announcement to <a href='https://www.solomontimes.com/news/president-tsai-ingwen-of-taiwan-issues-statement/9346'>reiterate her concerns</a> about China&rsquo;s behavior, remarking that &ldquo;in the face of China&rsquo;s interference and suppression, we will not stand to be threatened, nor will we be subjected to ceaseless demands.&rdquo;</p><p>For the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the implications are less clear. Each of the ANZUS countries already had relationships with both Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, so the underlying bilateral ties are unlikely to be fundamentally altered.</p><p>What is of more concern is what China may expect from these countries in return. On October 16, the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/australia/china-tulagi-solomon-islands-pacific.html'>New York Times</a> reported that a Chinese state-owned enterprise leased the island of Tulagi in the Solomon Islands.

   articleHTML:"<p>The Russian Federation&rsquo;s covert and overt activities in the Middle East and beyond have garnered the attention and concern of international observers in recent years. In particular, Russian private military companies &mdash; <a href='https://tass.com/defense/1037365'>technically illegal in Russia</a> &mdash; and their involvement in Libya and other conflicts in the region have prompted increasing Western scrutiny. This paramilitary activity coincides with Russia&rsquo;s efforts to expand its role as an instrumental broker of peace and power in the Middle East and Africa. As indirect and clandestine Russian efforts to change the military balance of power in Libya are increasingly coming to light, Russia is being forced to walk a finer and finer line in pursuing diplomatic influence.</p><p>After the ouster of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, fighting broke out among previously united rebel groups. In the last several years, power has been <a href='https://www.svoboda.org/a/29422172.html'>concentrated</a> in the hands of the U.N.-backed Government of National Unity and the rival coalition of the Libyan House of Representatives and the Libyan National Army (LNA). The LNA is headed by prominent political and military leader Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have so far been the major providers of <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/middleeast/russia-libya-mercenaries.html?searchResultPosition=1'>external support</a> to Haftar, while Turkey is the main foreign patron of the Government of National Unity.</p><p>Reports of Russian involvement in Libya have so far been intermittent, but they indicate the extensive use of private military proxies in the conflict, as well as a pattern of denial and secrecy. In February 2018, the Russian Ambassador to Libya <a href='https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999868120?accountid=10186'>denied</a> that Russia had any intent to establish a base or deploy its Aerospace Forces on antiterrorism missions in Libya. But in late 2018, suspicions were <a href='https://thebell.io/41889-2/'>raised</a> that Russia was sending troops to the war-torn country.</p><p>The role of the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group in Libya has attracted the most international scrutiny.

Prigozhin is a wealthy Russian businessman with close ties to President Vladimir Putin and many lucrative state contracts. Some of the funds from these state contracts were <a href='https://thebell.io/41889-2/'>allegedly</a> used to stand up private military companies such as Wagner. The United States imposed sanctions on the catering mogul for his role in the election-related influence campaigns orchestrated by the Internet Research Agency &ldquo;troll farm&rdquo; in St. Petersburg. The Wagner Group is arguably the best-known Russian private military company, involved in many conflicts worldwide.</p><p>By March 2019, concrete details began to emerge. The Telegraph of London <a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/03/russian-mercenaries-back-libyan-rebel-leader-moscow-seeks-influence/'>reported</a> that the Wagner Group had armed the LNA with artillery, tanks, drones and ammunition and was supporting Haftar with 300 personnel in Benghazi, a claim Russian authorities vehemently <a href='https://search.proquest.com/docview/2203054521?accountid=10186'>denied</a>. A hundred Wagner mercenaries were later reportedly <a href='https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/10/02/a-small-price-to-pay-for-tripoli'>deployed</a> to a forward base to support Haftar&rsquo;s September attack on Tripoli. More recently, hollow-point ammunition characteristic of Russian private military snipers has been <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/middleeast/russia-libya-mercenaries.html?searchResultPosition=1'>identified</a> in the corpses of Tripoli militia casualties. One <a href='https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/10/02/a-small-price-to-pay-for-tripoli'>assessment</a> estimates that there have been as many as 35 Wagner combat deaths in Libya. As evidence mounts, Russia&rsquo;s ability to distance itself from military activities in Libya is steadily being undermined.</p><p>Private military companies have often provided Russian authorities with plausible deniability in sensitive contexts. However, Russia appears especially concerned with concealing that support in Libya. Anecdotal <a href='https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/10/02/a-small-price-to-pay-for-tripoli'>evidence</a> suggests that loved ones back home in Russia were not notified when private military contractors died in Libya, a departure from the modus operandi for Russian mercenary casualties in other conflicts. Obscuring partisan links to the Libyan conflict clearly has an outsize importance for Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia has publicly <a href='https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124834002?accountid=10186'>emphasized</a> its desire to act as a guarantor in the Libyan conflict, and has <a href='http://tass.com/politics/1052745'>asserted</a> that it supports all parties equally. Russia also regularly uses its media to denounce the flouting of U.N. protocols, the support of anti-government forces, and outside intervention in &ldquo;domestic affairs.&rdquo; Definitive proof of Russian support to Haftar would significantly undermine Russia&rsquo;s efforts to promote its image as a neutral arbiter in Libya and in the region at large.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Russian state intervention in Libya&rsquo;s civil war has changed significantly in recent months, as reflected in Kate Baughman&rsquo;s recent <a href='/news/InDepth/article?ID=22'>InDepth post</a> on Russian activities in Libya. This follow-on commentary covers the implications of Russian activities on the Libyan conflict. An increase in Russian activity in Libya could alter the war&rsquo;s outcome, intensifying and prolonging the conflict, deepening factions and increasing the likelihood of a re-emergent Islamic State.</p><p>A brief period of optimism followed the 2011 overthrow of longtime strongman Muammar Qaddafi. However, since 2014 Libya has been mired in an increasingly stagnant civil war. The two primary belligerents are Khalifa Haftar&rsquo;s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) in the East and the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in the West. Haftar portrays himself as a strongman who can defeat Islamist militants and restore order to Libya, and a willing partner to other authoritarian regimes. In April 2019, Haftar began a campaign to take Tripoli, the country&rsquo;s capital city and the GNA&rsquo;s seat of power.</p><p>Russia has backed Haftar&rsquo;s forces throughout the conflict, despite its proclaimed neutrality. Since the initiation of the Tripoli offensive, Russia has demonstrated its support in two additional ways: <a href='https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/russia-strategy-libya-190710070457901.html'>by blocking a UN</a> Security Council resolution that would have condemned the Tripoli offensive, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/middleeast/russia-libya-mercenaries.html'>and by providing more lethal aid</a>, including hundreds of contractors.</p><p>One reason the Libyan civil war has persisted since 2014 is that both sides are weak. Neither belligerent has <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/middleeast/libya-hifter-benghazi.html?module=inline'>a unified military force</a>, but instead is made up of a series of frequently changing militias. Most of these militias are linked to a particular city and cannot project force more than one or two cities over. Targeted Russian interference through the introduction of a small contingent of well-trained mercenaries and sophisticated weapons could fundamentally shift this calculus in favor of the LNA and Haftar.</p><p>If Russian support facilitates the LNA capture of Tripoli, this could qualitatively change the nature of the conflict in three ways. First, a successful assault on Tripoli could upset the status quo on oil revenue. Libya&rsquo;s oil revenues currently flow to the Libyan Central Bank. These funds are then dispersed to forces on both sides of the conflict. Since both groups have an interest in maintaining this economic status quo, it has &mdash; somewhat counterintuitively &mdash; served as a safety net, preventing the conflict from worsening. If this were to change, the militias that now control Libya might turn predatory, engaging in more criminal activity and extracting wealth from the populations they claim to protect. Conflicts between militias over the control of revenue sources might also become more violent.</p><p>Second, a Haftar victory in Tripoli may embolden foreign military sponsors. While the conflict in Libya has long been a magnet for foreign intervention, there has been an increase in the sophistication of the weaponry sent to Libya this year. The powerful western militias that support the GNA, such as those from Misrata, have every incentive to keep fighting even if Tripoli falls. And like the LNA, they too have external support, most notably from Turkey. When the United Arab Emirates supplied Chinese-made armed drones to the LNA, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/middleeast/russia-libya-mercenaries.html'>Turkey provided</a> armed drones to the GNA. If this arms race continues, it will allow belligerents that might otherwise have been defeated to fight on, prolonging and intensifying the conflict.</p><p>Third, an intensified conflict and/or oil-revenue disruption would create the conditions for groups such as Islamic State to increase their scope of operations. In 2014 and 2015, Islamic State gained traction in Libya by occupying geographic and social seams. Increased violence, predatory militias and an influx of weaponry could lead to new social, economic and political seams that would be prime areas for Islamic State to recruit from and occupy.</p><p>Russia is one of many external actors fueling the civil war in Libya. However, the recent increase in aid to Haftar at a key time in his Tripoli campaign could have an outsized impact on the conflict and cause decisive shifts in the political and security landscape for years to come.</p>"},

   intro: "The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act released Monday night by a House-Senate conference committee authorizes the creation of a U.S. Space Force, the first new service created since 1947.",
   articleHTML:"<p>The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act released Monday night by a House-Senate conference committee authorizes the creation of a U.S. Space Force, the first new service created since 1947. Think of what that means: a Space Force would be the first service established in the post-McNamara, post-Cold War, Great Power Competition, hyperconnected 21st century. This is a HUGE opportunity to build a service that not only supports our national security space activities, but also sets an example as the leading edge of a modern defense organization.</p><p>Some have argued that a Space Force will be bureaucratically top-heavy, that its personnel structure will not be viable, that it will cost too much. These concerns all describe a future that certainly could come to pass. But it&rsquo;s not a certainty if the Department of Defense and Congress are willing to break the mold of the 20th Century in creating a Space Force.</p><p>Last year, CNA conducted a congressionally mandated study to design a Department of the Space Force. This effort provided valuable insights into critical aspects of a successful Space Force, the things a Space Force must do &mdash; and do differently than the existing services. The most critical of these are in three areas: staffing, acquisitions and organization.</p><p>First, a successful Space Force will need to deliberately advocate for and develop space and technical expertise. The challenges of providing deliberate career paths for space professionals within the existing system are well documented, and the unique characteristics of Space Force personnel argue for a new approach. For instance, personnel policies will need to address the role of the expanding space private sector as competition for personnel, but also as a potential source of staff. While the private sector role is particularly salient for space, it&rsquo;s not unique. So new personnel policies designed for a Space Force could benefit other services as well.</p><p>Personnel policies should also adapt to the highly technical demands of space operations. Many Space Force positions will benefit both from a depth of experience and from maintaining currency in space science, technology and engineering. So a Space Force might want to eliminate up-or-out rules and time-based promotions to retain technically talented and experienced military personnel. It might also consider career-incentive programs for internships with civilian employers and &mdash; perhaps most heretically &mdash; consider mid-career, lateral entry from the private sector and part-time employment options, even for active-duty military.</p><p>Second, the Space Force will have to do acquisitions differently, for three principal reasons: one, to account for the growing New Space sector, largely non-traditional contractors; two, to accommodate development-heavy, small volume programs; and three, to consider alternative types of acquisitions such as large volume, single-mission small satellites or commercial off-the-shelf products and services. Doing acquisition differently will require process and requirement flexibility to improve access to non-traditional contractors, accommodate different types of acquisitions and support spiral development-- allowing for incremental improvements in capability over program lifespans, rather than expecting all requirements to be satisfied before the first satellite launch. It will also require smart export control rules that allow the domestic industrial base to stabilize and flourish.</p><p>To implement these new processes and requirements, Space Force acquisition will need what the business world calls &ldquo;organizational ambidexterity.&rdquo; It will need to be able to support legacy and traditional acquisitions along standard paths and policies, while simultaneously engaging in novel acquisition pathways with new partners. This kind of ambidexterity requires separate acquisition pathways, each with its own separate budgets, staffs and processes. As the Department of Defense seeks to innovate more quickly while also supporting major legacy programs, Space Force acquisition could serve as a model for the other services.</p><p>Finally, the Space Force will need to be organized differently at headquarters. While many efforts in recent decades have sought to cut back on growing Pentagon overhead, the Space Force has the opportunity to start small. In fact, given public statements from legislators, we argued that it will only be viable as an independent service if it aims to be lean. To be clear, lean does not mean anemic. In certain areas, the Space Force will need service parity in rank and stature to be an effective advocate in interservice jockeying. But its headquarters organization can be purpose-built, including only those offices and leadership positions for which it has distinct responsibilities, rather than building it from other services&rsquo; molds. Given its small size, the Space Force could also provide service representation to combatant commands differently than its sister services, such as via embedded detachments or component elements, as opposed to fully staffed commands.</p><p>To be sure, there are certain institutional constraints within which a Space Force would need to operate. However, the fact that it will be a new organizational construct under new legislation provides an unprecedented opportunity to create the United States&rsquo; first modern military service. A Space Force can and should be staffed differently, make acquisitions differently, and organize itself differently. If this endeavor is executed thoughtfully and analytically, the end result will be not just better service support to the space domain. It could also lead the way to a better Department of Defense back here on the ground.</p>"},

   intro: "On December 2, Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin inaugurated the Power of Siberia pipeline, which links the world&rsquo;s largest natural gas exporter to the world&rsquo;s largest natural gas importer.",
   articleHTML:"<p>On December 2, Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin inaugurated the Power of Siberia pipeline, which links the world&rsquo;s largest natural gas exporter to the world&rsquo;s largest natural gas importer. Xi described the project as a &ldquo;landmark project of bilateral energy cooperation.&rdquo; The opening of the pipeline is the capstone of a nearly 20-year effort by Beijing to build the infrastructure necessary to make Russia into a major energy supplier to China. This process involved contentious negotiations and high-stakes diplomacy, with Russia&rsquo;s need for Chinese capital after the global financial crisis of 2007&ndash;2008 and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 adding impetus for cooperation.</p><p>For China, the pipeline is part of a larger picture that the United States should seek to understand. The importance of the Power of Siberia to Beijing goes beyond providing China with overland delivery of a large volume of natural gas. It is also a symbol of deepening ties between China and Russia at a time when both countries&rsquo; relationships with the United States are fraying. The longer the US-China trade war continues &mdash; and it is ongoing despite the announcement by Beijing and Washington on December 13 of a phase one deal &mdash; the more likely it is to contribute to the forging of even closer links between China and Russia.</p><p>With gas beginning to flow through the Power of Siberia, Russia is poised to become China&rsquo;s most important supplier of energy. In crude oil, Russia displaced Saudi Arabia as China&rsquo;s biggest supplier on an annual basis in 2016, due in large part to the construction of Russia&rsquo;s East Siberia Pacific Ocean pipeline and its spur to China, which began crude deliveries in 2011. Russia exported 1.4 million barrels per day of crude oil to China in 2018, accounting for 15 percent of China&rsquo;s crude oil imports. In natural gas, Russia was already supplying China with small volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), delivered by ship, accounting for one percent of China&rsquo;s LNG imports in 2018. Now the Power of Siberia pipeline is likely to make Russia one of China&rsquo;s largest &mdash; if not the largest &mdash; natural gas supplier after the pipeline ramps up to its full annual capacity of 38 billion cubic meters (bcm), which is targeted for 2024. For comparison, the 34 bcm of natural gas Turkmenistan delivered to China in 2018 was the most of any supplier in that year.&nbsp;</p><p>The flow of large volumes of Russian gas to China is important to Beijing for a variety of reasons, some of which emerged after Xi and Putin presided over the signing of the 30-year supply agreement for the Power of Siberia in May 2014. Specifically, the Chinese government regards the Power of Siberia as way to help meet China&rsquo;s growing demand for natural gas, diversify China&rsquo;s import portfolio, support coal-to-gas switching in northern China, forge closer ties to Russia at a time when both countries have tense relations with the United States, and remind the United States that China has alternatives to U.S. LNG. Each of these reasons is worth exploring in more detail.</p><p>Meet growing natural gas demand</p><p>The Chinese government aims for natural gas to comprise 15 percent of China&rsquo;s energy mix by 2030, up from 7.8 percent in 2018, as part of its effort to improve air quality and combat climate change. China is unlikely to achieve this target with domestic production alone. The country imported 45 percent of the natural gas it consumed in 2018. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China&rsquo;s largest oil and natural gas company, expects China&rsquo;s reliance on imported natural gas to exceed 50 percent by 2035, with imports of 310 bcm in that year. The 38 bcm to be delivered by the Power of Siberia constitutes 12 percent of this amount.</p><p>Diversify China&rsquo;s import portfolio</p><p>Beijing regards natural gas supplies from Russia as a way to diversify China&rsquo;s suppliers and import routes. The cutbacks in deliveries from Turkmenistan in the winter of 2017&ndash;2018, when China was experiencing severe natural gas shortages, the tightening of U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela in 2018 and 2019, the attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure in September 2019, and the ongoing trade war with the United States have all reinforced for China&rsquo;s government and oil companies the importance of not being too dependent on any single country or region. In addition, Beijing values oil and natural gas imports from Russia because they neither travel long distances through the sea-lines of communication nor transit the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca, the world&rsquo;s most strategic oil chokepoints by volume.</p><p>Support coal-to-gas switching</p><p>&nbsp;The Power of Siberia pipeline is likely to bolster Beijing&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to substitute natural gas for coal in heating in northern China, the country&rsquo;s coldest region, to reduce air pollution. During the third quarter of 2017, local authorities in these coal-burning provinces aggressively switched coal boilers to natural gas boilers, in some cases exceeding the targets set by the government. They subsequently discovered that they could not secure adequate natural gas supplies due to China&rsquo;s inadequate pipeline and storage infrastructure, leaving some residents out in the cold. The Power of Siberia should support coal-to-gas switching by delivering natural gas and also by spurring the construction of new infrastructure. Reuters reported on November 29 that more coal boilers were being removed and new pipelines laid in anticipation of the arrival of Russian gas.</p><p>Move closer to Russia.</p><p>Several commentators have described the pipeline as a manifestation of deeper China-Russia ties at a time when both countries&rsquo; relationships with the United States are deteriorating. During the ceremony for the launch of Power of Siberia, Xi and Putin both praised the pipeline as a symbol of closer bilateral relations. On that same day, Xi told Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev that China and Russia should stand closer to each other at a time when the United States and some other Western countries &ldquo;have increased their interference in the internal affairs of China and Russia, threatened the sovereign security of both countries, and impeded their social and economic development,&rdquo; according to a summary of the meeting posted on the website of China&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Remind Washington that China has alternatives to U.S. LNG. The launch of Power of Siberia is a high-profile reminder that China is deepening its relationships with other natural gas exporters while purchases from the U.S. are on hold due to the trade war. China was the third largest buyer of U.S. LNG in 2017 and appeared on track to import even more in 2018, before Beijing imposed a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG in September 2018, increased to a 25 percent tariff in June 2019. While China&rsquo;s imports of U.S. LNG decreased by 86 percent in the year after the initial tariff was imposed, purchases from other exporters grew, notably Australia, Malaysia and Russia, according to Chinese customs data.</p><p>Chinese government and oil company officials have indicated that Chinese purchases of LNG are likely to resume post-trade war. For example, Zhang Jianhua, the director of China&rsquo;s National Energy Administration, stated in September 2019 that &ldquo;if there is no trade war, we can import crude oil and natural gas from the United States. But because of the increase in tariffs, enterprises can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo; Similarly, in April 2019, Li Hui, a vice president of China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), said, &ldquo;For China-U.S. LNG trade, you have to look at the big trends and at the trade frictions. If this problem can be solved appropriately, LNG trade could be very big.&rdquo;</p><p>It is not entirely clear exactly what the phase one trade deal to be signed in January, means for U.S.-China energy trade. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, China has agreed to increase its purchases of a variety of U.S. goods and services, including energy, by $200 billion over the next two years. It is difficult to see how China can even come close to buying an additional $200 billion worth of goods and services from the United States without a lot of LNG. This, in turn, suggests that Beijing will remove the tariff on U.S. LNG. However, at this time neither Beijing nor Washington has provided information about the role of LNG in the trade deal.</p><p>The longer China&rsquo;s tariffs on U.S. LNG remain in place, the more Russia stands to benefit. Thanks to the trade war, Russia probably appears to China to be a more reliable supplier of energy than the United States. The Power of Siberia started deliveries weeks ahead of the start date agreed upon in 2017. In another project to build an LNG plant and port in northern Siberia, the Russian firm Novatek and its international partners (France&rsquo;s Total, China&rsquo;s CNPC and Silk Road Fund) completed the Yamal LNG project on time and on budget in December 2017 despite Western sanctions. CNPC has a contract to purchase 3 million tons of LNG per year (4 bcm) for 20 years from the project. CNPC and CNOOC are also invested in another Russian LNG project, Arctic LNG 2, which is likely to supply customers in China after it commences operations. Moreover, China and Russia have been discussing a second natural gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2, which would run from West Siberia to western China. Although Moscow has been much more enthusiastic about this project than Beijing, a prolonged trade war might increase Beijing&rsquo;s interest in seeing this project move off the drawing board.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>On January 5, al-Shabaab attacked a Kenyan airstrip used by the U.S. military, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/al-shabab-attacks-joint-us-kenyan-base-but-assault-repulsed-with-four-militants-killed/2020/01/05/6208f5a2-2f82-11ea-9b60-817cc18cf173_story.html'>killing three Americans</a>. Eight days earlier, al-Shabaab militants <a href='https://www.voanews.com/africa/al-shabab-claims-responsibility-deadly-bombing-somali-capital'>claimed responsibility</a> for a suicide truck bomb detonated in a busy intersection of Mogadishu, Somalia, killing more than 80 people. These attacks come more than two years after the United States declared that parts of Somalia as areas of &ldquo;active hostilities,&rdquo; which allowed for <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/africa/trump-is-said-to-ease-combat-rules-in-somalia-designed-to-protect-civilians.html'>expanded targeting authority</a> by the U.S. Africa Command. Since then, the number of U.S. counterterrorism strikes in Somalia has substantially increased, with <a href='https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/americas-counterterrorism-wars/somalia/'>145 strikes</a> under the Trump administration targeting both al-Shabaab and the Islamic State group, <a href='https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-al-shabab-commander-killed-20170804-story.html'>killing high-level commanders</a>. These strikes have not successfully diminished al-Shabaab&rsquo;s ability to carry out significant and symbolic attacks in Somalia and abroad. In fact, after enduring two years of U.S. airstrikes, the terrorist group seems emboldened.</p><p>One reason for al-Shabaab&rsquo;s continued survival is the group&rsquo;s ability to hone and implement a variety of tactics in its terror toolkit, carrying out an increasing number of sophisticated attacks in recent years. While al-Shabaab attacks usually have identifying features that serve as a signature, the attacks vary in size, scope, method and location, and are thus challenging to foresee and prevent. One such signature is the use of soft targets in Kenya, such as hotels, malls, and mixed-use office complexes. These attacks often turn into prolonged sieges, highlighting the limited response capability of local security forces. Suicide attacks and the use of improvised explosive devices within Somalia have also been a characteristic al-Shabaab tactic since 2008, when the group pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and <a href='https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/al-shabaab#highlight_text_13367'>adopted al-Qaeda&rsquo;s signature tactics</a>. <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/world/africa/somalia-attack-shabab.html'>United Nations experts determined</a> that al-Shabaab militants have been manufacturing their own roadside bombs since at least 2017. Their IED use has reached its highest rate to date.</p><p>Al-Shabaab hasn&rsquo;t rested on these well-established tactics, however. Several attacks highlight the group&rsquo;s ability to push the boundaries of their typical modus operandi. An October 2017 Mogadishu attack, when two suicide truck bombs <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/truck-bomb-mogadishu-kills-people-somalia'>killed nearly 600 people</a>, demonstrated the catastrophic extent of the group&rsquo;s reach. Though al-Shabaab never took responsibility for this attack, arguably because they had not anticipated the extent of the destruction and believed claiming responsibility would irrevocably damage their reputation, the <a href='https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/al-shabaab#text_block_13374'>Somali government</a> concluded that it bore the fingerprint of the group.</p><p>Further, the group has demonstrated a capacity to infiltrate sensitive and secure locations. For instance, the bold attack of Kenya&rsquo;s Manda Bay Airfield this week marks <a href='https://www.spymuseum.org/multimedia/spycast/episode/how-haven-t-i-heard-of-this-a-conversation-with-william-rosenau/https:/www.dw.com/en/al-shabab-attack-on-us-air-base-in-kenya-signals-resurgence/a-51905819'>the first time the group has attacked U.S. forces in Kenya</a>. The targeting of U.S. forces is likely a direct retaliation for increased U.S. airstrikes in Somalia, and is a significant and symbolic success for the group. Last August, al-Shabaab was similarly able to infiltrate a secure location when a blind, female employee of the Benadir Regional Administration, part of Somalia&rsquo;s municipal government, detonated a suicide bomb inside the regional headquarters, <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-security-bomber/somalia-says-blind-female-suicide-bomber-killed-mogadishu-mayor-idUSKCN1UZ1D0'>killing the mayor of Mogadishu</a> and several others.</p><p>Al-Shabaab remains a powerful and visible group, not only through these high-profile attacks, but also through a network of population control tactics beyond the reach of any airstrike. For example, al-Shabaab continues to garner revenue through extensive taxation and racketeering schemes across southern and central Somalia, and provides some basic services to areas where the government cannot. The breakdown in dialogue between the federal government and federal member states continues to impede the government&rsquo;s reach, rendering al-Shabaab a powerful and present alternative in some areas.</p><p>Somalia is at a critical moment for both its security and democracy. The December 2020 date for Somali forces to <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/world/africa/somalia-explosion-mogadishu.html'>assume responsibility</a> for the fight against al-Shabaab from the peacekeepers of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) is quickly approaching. <a href='https://allafrica.com/stories/201912290081.html'>Upcoming universal suffrage elections</a> will be the first in Somalia since 1969. In this context, the threat from al-Shabaab continues to threaten the heart of Somali and regional security, despite the efforts of the United States, African Union and the Somali government. Further, several of al-Shabaab&rsquo;s recent attacks highlight an increasing sophistication and experimentation in tactics that underscore the group&rsquo;s continued effectiveness. Al-Shabaab today combines decades of experience in adopting and adapting new tactics along with a bold willingness to &nbsp;experiment with risky, high-visibility attacks. Despite significant U.S. efforts, these terrorists are far from diminished.</p>"},

The World Health Organization, Chinese health authorities, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are all critical to this effort. However, CNA&rsquo;s Center for Public Health Preparedness and Resilience has also learned from 20 years of experience evaluating responses to public health emergencies that in addition to thinking globally, it is essential to coordinate locally.</p><p>First detected last month in Wuhan, China, the virus has sickened hundreds of people and killed more than two dozen. The number of confirmed cases jumped significantly over the past week as public health officials in China ramped up surveillance. Additional cases have been identified in several other countries, including the United States. While much still needs to be learned about the virus, it appears capable of spreading from person to person. This has heightened concerns in the U.S. and global health communities about the potential for 2019-nCoV to cause a large-scale epidemic.</p><p>U.S. health authorities are closely monitoring the situation and have implemented certain precautions, &nbsp;including screening passengers coming from Wuhan at five major U.S. airports: JFK in New York, San Francisco International, Los Angeles International, Chicago-O&rsquo;Hare, and Atlanta&rsquo;s Hartsfield International Airport. Similar enhanced screenings were a critical component of the U.S. response to the 2014&ndash;2016 Ebola epidemic, though it&rsquo;s important to emphasize that the two viruses are vastly different. During the response to Ebola, entry screenings proved to be an effective method to establish a risk profile for people entering the country from areas where the disease was occurring. The screenings also helped to mollify those calling for stricter disease containment measures, such as travel bans or border closures. Such extreme measures have no proven public health benefit and are fraught with potential unintended consequences that can adversely affect our nation&rsquo;s health security.</p><p>The efficacy of enhanced entry screenings in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak remains to be seen. Health authorities will undoubtedly revisit these and other protective measures as we learn more about this particular virus. What we do know is that close coordination between federal, state and local public health and health care authorities is critical to any response in a scenario like this. This will help ensure that all parties have the information they need to rapidly detect and respond to emerging threats and address the public&rsquo;s concerns. Coordination is also vital for monitoring the impact that federal guidance and interventions can have on local, frontline resources, which are already stretched thin in many areas of the country. For example, federal guidance for personal protective equipment should accurately reflect capacity within supply chains for that equipment.</p><p>The 2019-nCoV outbreak is rapidly evolving and warrants our attention. We must ensure that in addition to the best available science, a practical understanding of state and local public health capabilities and resources informs our national response.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Marking the opening of the <a href='https://tass.com/economy/1094679'>Power of Siberia</a> natural gas pipeline between Russia and China in early December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the pipeline &ldquo;brings the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership in the energy sector to a whole new level.&rdquo; His counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping, <a href='http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/03/c_138603219.htm'>described</a> it as &ldquo;a landmark project of China-Russia energy cooperation and a paradigm of deep convergence of both countries' interests and win-win cooperation.&rdquo; Their strong statements seem aimed at multiple audiences: domestic populations who see their countries suffering from disputes with the United States, domestic elites looking for clear signals of their respective leaders&rsquo; priorities, elites in the other nation looking for signs of mutual commitment to the China-Russia partnership, and &mdash; of course &mdash; Washington and its allies and partners. But is the pipeline really that important? In a previous InDepth article, my colleague Erica Downs discussed the importance of this pipeline to China. Below I will address what it means for Russia.</p><p>Power of Siberia, or <em>Sila Sibiri</em> in Russian, was a core element of the May 2014 agreement through which Russia&rsquo;s gas giant Gazprom is eventually to deliver some 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to China each year for 30 years. At the time, observers valued the deal at <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-russia-gas/as-putin-looks-east-china-and-russia-sign-400-billion-gas-deal-idUSBREA4K07K20140521'>$400 billion</a>. Experts project that it will supply close to 10 percent of China&rsquo;s gas by <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/asia/china-russia-gas-pipeline-intl-hnk/index.html'>2022</a>. In addition to <em>Sila Sibiri&rsquo;s</em> role as a symbolic, economic and physical connection between Russia and China, Moscow has touted the pipeline as a way to diversify Russia&rsquo;s gas markets away from Europe, where demand growth has slowed, and to mitigate the impacts of U.S. and European sanctions. A recent article published by <em>Sputnik News</em>, Russia&rsquo;s official foreign propaganda outlet, highlighted these themes under the title &ldquo;<a href='https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201912031077467316-russia-china-pipeline-connecting-siberia-to-shanghai-bypasses-us-strategic-clout/'>Russia-China Pipeline from Siberia to Shanghai Bypasses U.S. &lsquo;Strategic Clout</a>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>$400 billion is clearly a significant sum for Russia or any other nation, even over thirty years. But to put the <em>Sila Sibiri</em> pipeline into context, the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany will reportedly double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline to a total of 110 bcm per year. Thus <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-2/gazprom-nord-stream-2-cost-would-rise-by-hundreds-of-millions-to-bypass-denmark-idUSKBN1WJ16X'>Nord Stream 2</a> alone could handle 55 bcm per year, or about 50 percent more gas than <em>Sila Sibiri</em>. The two Nord Stream pipelines together could deliver triple the gas that China has contracted.</p><p><a href='http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/'>Gazprom</a> says that it exported 58.5 bcm to Germany and 162.4 bcm to Western Europe in 2018. Also that year, Gazprom sent an additional 38.4 bcm &mdash; almost the identical quantity promised to China &mdash; to central and Eastern Europe. Russia&rsquo;s leading energy economists expect <a href='https://www.eriras.ru/files/forecast_2019_en.pdf'>exports to China</a> to remain a fraction of those to Europe for decades to come. From the customer&rsquo;s end of these relationships, Russia&rsquo;s share of China&rsquo;s total gas consumption will also be significantly smaller than its share of German and European consumption. Moscow and Beijing may therefore each have less relative pipeline-related leverage over one another than Moscow and Berlin have.</p><p>China is also likely to be a less profitable customer for Russia. The expansive <em>Sila Sibiri </em>mega-project is much more expensive than Nord Stream 2, despite the China project&rsquo;s smaller capacity. Nord Stream 2&rsquo;s original price tag was projected at 9.5 billion euros, or about $10.5 billion, though it could end up somewhat higher; <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-2/gazprom-nord-stream-2-cost-would-rise-by-hundreds-of-millions-to-bypass-denmark-idUSKBN1WJ16X'><em>Sila Sibiri</em></a> requires developing not only the pipeline, but also new gas fields and infrastructure, with the total cost estimated at <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-china-gas/update-1-gazprom-says-china-starts-building-part-of-power-of-siberia-idUSL5N0YO1XM20150602'>$55 billion</a>. On top of this, <a href='https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/China%20Russia%20gas%20deal_Staffbackgrounder.pdf'>outside observers</a> generally believe that the deal required Gazprom price concessions. Contemporaneous accounts hinted at a price at the low end of Gazprom&rsquo;s European price range and below what China would have paid for liquified natural gas (LNG) imports in the Asian market.</p><p>Notably, the initial <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-russia-gas/as-putin-looks-east-china-and-russia-sign-400-billion-gas-deal-idUSBREA4K07K20140521'>Chinese-Russian agreement</a> came in May 2014, about two months after the Obama administration&rsquo;s first executive order authorizing U.S. sanctions on Russia in the wake of Moscow&rsquo;s occupation of Crimea. During the two months preceding the deal, the United States and the European Union closely coordinated <a href='https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/index.htm'>new sanctions</a> announcements in an effort to pressure Russia to change its behavior. Russia&rsquo;s economy was already in trouble before this; after a brief rebound following the <a href='https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=RU'>2008-2009 financial crisis</a>, growth was slowing in 2013 and the <a href='https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/10/01/russia-economic-update'>World Bank</a> expected continued difficulty if Russia did not pursue structural reforms.</p><p>Whether the pipeline will actually bring Moscow and Beijing closer together outside their energy relationship &mdash; much less cement some kind of Chinese-Russian alliance, as some seem to fear &mdash; is harder to quantify than <em>Sila Sibiri&rsquo;s </em>economic and energy impacts. Thus far, <em>Sila Sibiri </em>appears to reflect, rather than drive, the Russia-China alignment. Shared complaints about Washington are the fuel in the engine of Russia-China relations, not natural gas. While the project will doubtless establish and strengthen personal ties among individuals in the two governments and in the principal firms involved, <em>Sila Sibiri </em>seems most important in its symbolic power and in dramatically opening China&rsquo;s large and growing gas market to Russian exports.</p><p>Looking ahead, it bears noting that if Gazprom can build a Nord Stream 2, the firm and its Chinese partners could develop <em>Sila Sibiri </em>2 &mdash; or something else &mdash; if market conditions warrant. Indeed, in the more distant future, Russia&rsquo;s natural gas could become a key element in China&rsquo;s emerging strategy to lead in <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-23/now-china-wants-to-lead-the-world-in-hydrogen-fuel-cells'>hydrogen fuel cell</a> production for electric vehicles. Natural gas, composed primarily of methane (CH4), is rich in hydrogen.</p><p>For now, analysts and officials should certainly watch the Russia-China energy relationship &mdash; but they should do so without becoming swept up in the hype. A single pipeline can only be understood within the complete framework of Russia&rsquo;s and China&rsquo;s energy relationships.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Lebanon formed a new government on January 21 after weeks of violent protests across the country dubbed &quot;100 days of rage.&quot; The country had been without a prime minister and functioning cabinet since the departure of Prime Minister Saad Hariri in October. For the first time in months, U.S. officials now have a functioning Lebanese cabinet they can work as the two countries face a range of problems: ongoing instability in the region, U.S. tensions with Iran, Lebanon&rsquo;s failing economy and an ISIS resurgence in the Levant.</p><p>Some ISIS networks fled to Lebanon after operations by the Syrian military and its allies Iran and Hezbollah. ISIS retains significant latent capability and thrives on continued instability and poor governance. The stability of Lebanon is critical to ongoing efforts to contain and defeat ISIS.</p><p>All of these developments are important to U.S. defense policy. Regardless what elected officials are in power in Beirut, the Lebanese military has traditionally remained a close U.S. defense partner and a reliable ally. The Lebanese Armed Forces have some of the most capable special operations forces of any Arab military &mdash; except perhaps the United Arab Emirates &mdash; due largely to years of training and joint operations with U.S. special operations forces. Despite the country&rsquo;s political uncertainty, it has remained a cohesive, resilient force and retains a certain degree of autonomy from politics. But the country&rsquo;s ongoing troubles have taken a toll. The new government has a critical role in maintaining the capability and impartiality of the Lebanese Armed Forces.</p><p>There are some troubling signs for the United States in the new government. Some ministers are worryingly close to Hezbollah. That raises concerns about Iranian influence, threats to Israel and whether the new prime minister might help Iran and Russia to prop up the Assad regime in Syria.</p><p>The pro-Iran, anti-Israel Shia militia appears to have more sympathetic ministers in the new cabinet than has been the case at any time in Lebanon&rsquo;s history. There is also relatively little representation from the country&rsquo;s Sunni and Christian communities to balance Hezbollah&rsquo;s influence. This is a break from past precedent, in which successive Lebanese governments have included ministers representing each of the country&rsquo;s major Muslim, Christian and Druze confessional groups.</p><p>Despite being a responsive U.S. partner, the Lebanese military has made it clear that it cannot and will not take action or even threatening steps against Hezbollah or Iranian networks in the country. The new government in Beirut will be even less likely to take concerted action against Iranian-sponsored anti-American activities. Also, Beirut may not be as cooperative when it comes to forcing Lebanese banks to abide by U.S. sanctions against Hezbollah and Iranian-linked businesses and organizations. Hezbollah has even made gradual and quiet inroads into the leadership of the Lebanese Armed Forces. This will be a problem for the U.S. partnership, especially since the killing of Iranian Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani, who was close to Hezbollah.</p><p>Perceptions of Hezbollah influence in the new government among other Arab states may increase Lebanon&rsquo;s isolation from Sunni governments hostile to Iran &mdash; especially Saudi Arabia and UAE &mdash; and may increase tensions with Israel. Saudi Arabia has pulled economic and military aid in the past following concerns about Hezbollah influence in Beirut and in the Lebanese Armed Forces. Lebanon is in dire economic straits; the drying up of aid from wealthy Arab states could not come at a worse time. Lebanon will be in critical need of financial aid from the U.S. and Europe. Depending on how forthcoming that assistance is, the new government may be receptive to aid from Russia and China, which are both looking for greater influence in the country. Lebanon may also be receptive to closer ties with the Assad regime in Damascus, potentially creating more problems for the United States.</p><p>Lebanon has suffered from over nine years of civil war in Syria, which has caused waves of refugees to flood into the country. Lebanon is a small country of just six million people divided along religious lines. It is especially vulnerable to spillover from the civil war on its border, which has upset its already delicate ethnic and religious balance while putting strains on the economy and public services. The country&rsquo;s economic woes and widespread protests are partly a function of the Syrian conflict.</p><p>Despite concerns about Hezbollah and ISIS, it was inequality, corruption and economic mismanagement that brought Lebanese from all walks of life into the streets &mdash; including Shia and supporters of Hezbollah. The mandate of the new government is to address these economic problems, not to do Iran&rsquo;s bidding against the United States, threaten Israel, or prop up the Assad regime in Syria. The further leaders in Beirut veer from economic issues, the more likely they are to face new waves of protests and calls for their ouster.</p><p>These constraints suggest that the new government, regardless of its ties to Hezbollah, is likely to be a pragmatic one. U.S. officials can work with the new leadership on stabilizing the economy, preventing an ISIS resurgence and developing the Lebanese Armed Forces. Some caution may be in order on Hezbollah, Iran, and Syria&rsquo;s Assad, but these too are issues that Washington and Beirut can at least discuss, now that Lebanon has a government. There is room for common ground.</p>"},

   intro: "Abuse of vulnerable populations by those hired to care for them is a significant social problem in the United States.",   
   articleHTML:"<p>Abuse of vulnerable populations by those hired to care for them is a significant social problem in the United States. News reports of incidents of abuse are disturbing &mdash; and far too common. For example, a home health aide with an extensive criminal history who was using an alias was charged with writing unauthorized checks for thousands of dollars on the account of the person in her care. In another facility, a certified nursing assistant who had a previous assault conviction &mdash; and therefore should have been barred from direct contact with residents &mdash; molested a nursing home resident during a back massage. Perhaps most shockingly, a home health care aide on probation for burglary was convicted of murdering his 74-year-old former employer while burglarizing her home. The crime inspired a new state law that now requires criminal background checks for anyone seeking a home health care aide position.</p><p>Better background screening could have prevented those cases and countless others like them. More robust and consistent background screening of all long-term care and childcare workers is a proactive, preventative measure that can improve the safety and security of our youngest and oldest citizens. But nationwide consistency is needed to make existing background check programs more effective. Given that states often respond only to federal requirements with funding implications, better screenings will result if the following recommendations are implemented through federal legislation and rule-making:</p><ul class='custom-list-arrow'><li>Require fingerprint-based state and national criminal history checks to prevent identity fraud and uncover activity in other states.</li><li>Require searches of additional databases for administrative findings of unsuitability, including in other states.</li><li>Require statewide eligibility determinations with consistent criteria and an independent review process that applies to all types of care providers.</li><li>Require the same screening for all workers, owners/operators and contract staff who have access to care recipients or their assets.</li><li>Require those screenings for care workers in all settings, including home care, residential care (assisted living), and managed care environments.</li></ul><p>Two comprehensive national background check programs have already proven such screenings can be implemented effectively, efficiently and equitably &mdash; and in all states.</p><p>The National Background Check Program (NBCP), authorized in 2010, is a voluntary program that has provided grants to 29 states to implement robust, statewide screening programs meeting the requirements described above to vet persons who work in long-term care facilities.</p><p>And in 2014, the Child Care Development Block Grant Reauthorization Act (CCDBGA) added a requirement across all states and territories that standardizes many of the same requirements for those who work in childcare settings. More than 40 states have passed legislation to implement checks that include fingerprint-based criminal history and additional information from other states.</p><p>Instead of adding to the patchwork, I recommend fine-tuning those two existing programs. For NBCP, broader implementation will solidify and publicize the significant successes experienced by states that did pass legislation leading to full implementation of the program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can readily re-open the NBCP grant program and engage in outreach to encourage the remaining states. In addition, provisions should be added to the grant to tie grant resources to the passage of authorizing legislation. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can also support the expansion of the National Nurse Aide Registry to encompass all states, regardless of whether the state participates in NBCP. As an added incentive, Congress could set a timeline to incorporate NBCP into the regulatory legislation, much as it did for the CCDBGA.</p><p>CCDBGA background checks show that federal mandates do prompt state legislation. But fine tuning of the requirements is needed to improve data sharing among states, eliminate unnecessary overlap among the required searches, and provide more complete data from states about the metrics of their background checks. The Administration for Children and Families could proceed with its study of the relative value of interstate criminal history checks, such as the child abuse and sex offender registries. Congress could require every state and territory to establish and maintain a publicly available registry of child abuse perpetrators that would be accessible to childcare worker screening agencies in other states, similar to the nurse aide registries used for long-term care worker screening. Finally, the Administration for Children and Families could require states to submit a standard set of administrative data on all background checks conducted under the CCDBGA to monitor effectiveness and efficiency.</p><hr /><p>Ernest Baumann is a Sr. Principal Technical Advisor in CNA&rsquo;s Center for Vulnerable Population Protection.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Last Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href='https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1230807986857226245'>announced on Twitter</a> that the United States had officially &ldquo;come to an understanding with the Taliban on a significant reduction in violence across Afghanistan.&rdquo; This announcement was notable, not only because it signified the possibility of some much-needed relief for the violence-plagued people of Afghanistan, but also because it was a precondition for the U.S. to agree to the signing of an official deal with the Taliban. Pompeo&rsquo;s announcement was quickly confirmed by <a href='https://twitter.com/suhailshaheen1/status/1230820419764047873'>a tweet from Suhail Shaheen</a>, the Taliban&rsquo;s political spokesman, who added that the formal U.S.-Taliban deal would be signed on February 29 in Doha, Qatar. Intra-Afghan negotiations would then begin within weeks of the signing ceremony, at least according to media reports. In those talks, the Taliban will formally discuss the future of the country with a representative group of Afghans that includes members of the government.</p><p>Pompeo called this development, &ldquo;an important step on a long road to peace&rdquo; &mdash; an apt way of describing the situation, since there are many issues yet to be resolved. Here, I&rsquo;ll briefly discuss four that are especially important.</p><p>First is the issue of Taliban coherence and whether the group&rsquo;s leaders can bring their entire organization out of the cold as part of a peace deal. There have been questions about the Taliban&rsquo;s organizational coherence for years. Proponents have argued that events like the successful Eid ceasefire of 2018 demonstrated the ability of Taliban leaders to control their fighters, while detractors have pointed to rifts between the political and military councils of the group&rsquo;s leadership structure over talks with the U.S. as evidence divisions within the group. Washington clearly has lingering questions of its own; and designed the reduction-in-violence precondition in part to test the Taliban&rsquo;s ability to rein in its field commanders and fighting ranks for a week.</p><p>A second issue is the role of the Haqqani Network. The Haqqanis have presented a sticking point for the U.S. all along, since unlike the Taliban, they are a U.S.-designated <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations'>Foreign Terrorist Organization</a>. But they are also part of the Taliban&rsquo;s organization, a point made abundantly clear when Sirajuddin Haqqani was elevated to the number two position in the Taliban hierarchy several years ago. The issue of whether or not the Haqqanis will go along with a peace deal is a lingering one, tied into the question of the broader coherence of the Taliban. <em>The New York Times</em> controversially published <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/taliban-afghanistan-war-haqqani.html'>an editorial attributed to Siraj Haqqani</a> titled &ldquo;What We, the Taliban, Want,&rdquo; which was clearly aimed at trying to put these questions to rest.</p><p>Third is the issue of the Afghan government&rsquo;s own coherence. The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan finally announced the results of Afghanistan&rsquo;s presidential election last week. (The timing, so close to the announcements from the U.S.-Taliban talks, may not have been coincidental.) The election &mdash; held last September &mdash; was declared in favor of the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, by just 0.6 points more than the 50 percent vote tally he needed to secure a first-round victory. But voter turnout was the lowest in Afghanistan&rsquo;s history. About two million votes were cast from among some 10 million registered voters. And the level of fraud in this election was again notable, with plenty of evidence of ballot box stuffing and other illegal activities. Ghani&rsquo;s primary opponent &mdash; until recently, his chief executive officer&mdash;Abdullah Abdullah, declared his own, parallel government. This level of political turmoil couldn&rsquo;t come at a worse time, and it raises serious questions as to whether the elites in Kabul can coalesce in time to provide a united front in negotiations with the Taliban, or whether they will come to the table divided.</p><p>A fourth issue to be resolved on the road to peace is the implementation and monitoring of the impending U.S.-Taliban deal in the months to follow. As described by the eminent scholar of Afghanistan Barnett Rubin in a recent Washington Post op-ed, &ldquo;The agreement provides a timetable for troop withdrawal, counterterrorism guarantees, a path to a cease-fire and a process for political settlement. Implementation would also require dismantling Taliban infrastructure in neighboring Pakistan and assurances by external powers that none will use Afghanistan against others.&rdquo; These are heady issues that require significant, sustained actions in order to translate the words of a deal into lasting change on the ground. Rubin writes that &ldquo;an annex [to the deal] establishes a center where the U.S. military and Taliban will share counterterrorist information and monitor possible violations.&rdquo; But what will that center look like? Where will it exist? Will it be &ldquo;real&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtual,&rdquo; like <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/asia/afghanistan-whatsapp-taliban.html'>a series of WhatsApp chat rooms</a>? What is its remit and what are the limits of its actions? And if violations are discovered, what then? As Rubin<a href='https://twitter.com/BRRubin/status/1088611230099607552'> said previously</a>, &ldquo;Peace agreements are <em>not</em> based on trust. They are based on mutual interest, verification and enforcement.&rdquo; Exactly how the implementation of this deal will be verified and enforced remains to be seen.</p><p>There are many more questions that Afghans will need to address among themselves. Among these are the prospect of a full and comprehensive ceasefire, the rights of women and minorities, the fate of Afghanistan&rsquo;s current constitution and structure of future governments, the reintegration of Taliban fighters &mdash; potentially into the Afghan security forces &mdash; and the relationship of any post-peace government with the international community, including the continued provision of international aid on which Afghanistan&rsquo;s economy relies heavily. But first things first. If the reduction in violence can hold for just a few more days, the U.S. and the Taliban will cement the first formal step in their road to peace. Then the hard task of addressing the questions I&rsquo;ve posed above will begin in earnest.</p><hr/><p>Jonathan Schroden directs the Stability and Development Program.

   articleHTML:"<p>February 21 marked the 50th anniversary of the day the Gates Commission presented its <a href='https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webS0243.pdf'>report</a> on the military draft to President Nixon, concluding, &ldquo;We unanimously believe that the nation&rsquo;s interests will be better served by an all-volunteer force.&rdquo; Two generations later, that transformative moment seems deceptively mundane. It is easy to forget the level of opposition to ending conscription and the struggle in the ensuing years to make the all-volunteer force succeed.</p><p>Former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates was among those opponents, until persuaded by analysis from the commission&rsquo;s research staff, drawn largely from federally funded research and development centers like RAND and CNA. The <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/10/archives/defense-payload.html'>New York Times</a> expressed establishment skepticism, calling the all-volunteer Army &ldquo;a real problem&rdquo; that imposed &ldquo;excruciating costs.&rdquo; And resistance was widespread in the Pentagon.</p><p>Personally, we feel some empathy for the skeptics. We believe that all Americans share in the responsibility for national defense and that young people benefit by serving their country. But personal feelings must yield to objective analysis. Between the two of us, we have spent more than 80 years observing the all-volunteer force, one as a draftee who rose to the highest enlisted rank in the Marine Corps, one as a civilian analyst who has accompanied the Marines into battle. Both experience and data tell us the all-volunteer force has resulted in the most experienced, best-educated, most qualified troops this country &mdash; and perhaps the world &mdash; has ever seen.</p><p>Many of these improvements would be staggering even to draft protesters a half-century ago. Discipline is dramatically better. Nonjudicial punishments and courts-martial have fallen from 184 per 1,000 troops in the last year of the draft to just 33 per 1,000. Enlistees are better educated &mdash; <a href='/research/pop-rep'>97 percent hold a high school diploma</a>, compared to just 71 percent in the last decade of the draft. University-level coursework, once rare among enlisted forces, has become a routine part of their advancement.</p><p>Costly investments in education would be wasted if the beneficiaries left the force, but today&rsquo;s recruits are much more likely to make a career in the military. The year before the draft ended, fewer than 16 percent of sailors reenlisted when they reached the end of their first term. Today, <a href='https://news.usni.org/2019/05/16/navy-must-retain-80-percent-of-sailors-annually-to-grow-fleet'>the Navy targets</a> a 70 to 80 percent first-term reenlistment rate. Maintaining a more experienced force requires higher pay, but it&rsquo;s fiscally responsible too &mdash; reducing the cost of finding and training recruits. In constant dollars, total personnel costs for the better-paid, more experienced, smaller force today is actually lower than in any of the draft years.&nbsp;</p><p>The all-volunteer force has proven its value in war. One of us witnessed Desert Storm up close and recalls discreetly advising a micromanaging officer that the bright, experienced troops in his charge actually needed a lot less direction. As seen in the results of that war, they knew what they were doing. In Iraq and Afghanistan, an exceptional share of the operational burden has fallen on some of the oldest, most experienced of the career enlisted forces &mdash; in special operations.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising benefit of the all-volunteer force has been the opportunities it opened up for women. The Gates report hardly mentions them at all. But soon after Congress voted to end the draft, an analyst advised the Defense Department that every woman who enlisted would save the services $10,000 &mdash; the extra cost of attracting another man. The women who make up <a href='/research/pop-rep'>16 percent of U.S. forces</a> today have literally made it possible to staff the all-volunteer force without reducing standards &mdash; and with unforeseen benefits. One recent <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/DRM-2019-U-019962-Final.pdf'>CNA study</a> for the Department of the Navy found that compared to women, male sailors have higher rates of misbehavior, generating more than 3,000 extra misbehavior incidents annually<strong>, </strong>costing at least $250 million.</p><p>It would be na&iuml;ve to conclude that successes in the past five decades were some automatic result of ending the draft. In fact, the first years of the all-volunteer force were difficult ones. Years passed before Washington found the political will to spend what was required to attract and retain enlistees. CNA and other research organizations that assisted the Gates Commission produced shelves full of studies used to efficiently target military personnel resources. For example, analyses showed that recruits with high school diplomas are much less likely to leave early &mdash; a fundamental reason why diploma-holders are the norm in today&rsquo;s forces.</p><p>Nor can the future success of the all-volunteer force be taken for granted. Low civilian unemployment can make it more difficult to find high-quality recruits. Only with renewed investment and scientific analysis will an increasingly technological military be able to maintain the forces it requires. Now that we can confidently say the Gates Commission was correct, Washington needs to nurture the volunteer force that has ably served the country for nearly half a century.</p><hr/><p>Katherine McGrady is the CEO of CNA.

   intro: "In 2015, the Department of the Navy tripled the amount of fully paid leave available to new mothers from 6 to 18 weeks.",   
   articleHTML:"<p>In 2015, the Department of the Navy tripled the amount of fully paid leave available to new mothers from 6 to 18 weeks. And though the Department of Defense forced the Department of the Navy to eventually scale back their leave to 12 weeks in order to create a consistent policy across the services, the large increase in maternity leave created a quasi-experiment on the impact of maternity leave on personnel. As part of a suite of studies on the effect of personnel policies on budgets and personnel inventories, sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, we estimated the effect that the expanded maternity leave policy &mdash; combining the 18- and 12-week policies &mdash; had on the reenlistment of female sailors.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that longer paid maternity leave in the Navy increased the number of female sailors who reenlist, reducing what had been a small but persistent gender gap in reenlistment rates in a cost-effective manner. A concern surrounding the expansion of maternity leave was that it might result in fewer weeks worked, placing stress on Navy units. But in fact, we calculate that the extra weeks of work lost to new mothers were compensated by three times as many weeks of extra work from increased reenlistments.</p><p>Analyzing Navy maternity leave policy requires a different approach than that for civilian policy, but it comes with several advantages. Many studies of civilian maternity leave policies examine how likely women are to return to work after taking leave. Sailors, however, commit to fixed-length service obligations. So we instead look at how likely a sailor is to reenlist at the end of his or her initial service obligation. This also lets us look at whether additional maternity leave works as a reenlistment tool among women who do not yet have children but might be more likely to reenlist knowing that the longer maternity leave policy is available for future use. To our knowledge, no studies of civilian policy have addressed this topic. Finally, the new policy was quickly implemented, widely publicized and automatically made available to all sailors, making it an ideal experimental subject.</p><p>To estimate the policy&rsquo;s effect, we used a difference-in-differences model. The model compares reenlistment rates of female sailors with those of male sailors without military spouses &mdash; who do not benefit, even indirectly, from the policy. The model also compares reenlistment rates before and after the policy went into effect. For about two years prior to the expansion of maternity leave, the reenlistment rates of male sailors were higher than those for female sailors. But after the new maternity leave policy was implemented, the gender gap in reenlistment disappeared. After controlling for sailors&rsquo; background characteristics and service histories, we find that the expansion of maternity leave increased the reenlistment rate of female sailors by 3.7 percentage points relative to that of male sailors.</p><p>Even female sailors without children seem to be encouraged to reenlist by better maternity leave. Their reenlistment rates increased by 3.6 percentage points, similar to those for female sailors overall. This result may suggest that sailors are thinking of future career and personal flexibility as much as benefits already received when making their reenlistment decision.</p><p>We can begin to quantify the value of those gains in dollars by comparing them to the Selective Reenlistment Bonuses (SRBs) the Navy pays to increase the reenlistment rate of sailors in particular skill specialties. For example, based on previous analyses we can estimate that to incentivize the same 3.7 percentage point increase in the reenlistment rate using bonuses, the Navy would have to offer Petty Officers Second Class (paygrade E-5) an extra $15,000 at reenlistment. Note, however, that SRBs affect male and female sailors roughly equally. Furthermore, SRBs are targeted to encourage reenlistment in occupations for which the Navy struggles to maintain sufficient manning and are not meant to address gender imbalances. Thus, SRBs are entirely appropriate and particularly efficient for addressing occupational shortages, but they are ill-suited for addressing a retention gender gap.</p><p>To return to the question of how weeks of work lost to longer maternity leave compare with weeks gained by higher reenlistment, we can compute back-of-the-envelope estimates. During fiscal year 2017, there were 1,236 births to four-year-obligation sailors. We estimate that compared with the old six-week maternity leave policy, these births generated approximately 8,500 additional weeks of leave under the new policy. During this period, 4,412 female sailors reached the end of an initial four-year obligation &mdash; the reenlistment decision point. If an additional 3.7 percent of these sailors reenlisted for an average duration of 3.5 years, this would translate to 164 sailors reenlisting for approximately 28,000 additional weeks. In short, by accepting a small additional loss of 8,500 weeks of work time by new mothers, the Navy could gain three times as many total work weeks from the sailors who might not have reenlisted without the increase in maternity leave. The difference is so large that even if these estimates were off dramatically and the reenlistment effect were up to three times smaller, there would still be a net gain in weeks worked. Furthermore, the additional reenlistments should increase sailors&rsquo; total sea duty; the length of maternity leave does not affect the amount of sea duty lost to pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p>While it remains to be seen whether the gains from this change in policy persist as it becomes the new status quo, it nevertheless provides proof of concept that non-monetary benefits may affect particular groups of sailors at least as effectively as cash bonuses. And while questions remain about maternity leave and workplace attachment in the civilian world, this study provides evidence that such policies may help employers retain their female employees prior to starting a family.</p><hr/><p>Daniel Leeds is a Research Analyst in CNA&rsquo;s Resource and Force Readiness Division.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>The world is evolving rapidly. A reversion to great power politics and mercantilist trade wars roils international politics. As traditional resource pools dwindle, oil, gas and mining companies and fishing fleets are pushing into new regions and seeking untapped resource. Curiously, all this human activity is most consequential where humans are virtually absent: at the Earth&rsquo;s poles. Twenty years ago the Arctic, covered in ice pack, was untouched aside from a few hardy explorers and the occasional submarine. Now the High North buzzes with new maritime transport routes, tourism, and fishing. The region has become another square in the game board of great power competition.</p> <p>Today, a similar process is unfolding in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean that surrounds it. For decades the continent was largely ignored and left to scientists by treaty, but it is now increasingly under the eye of China, a rising power keen to establish its presence and score influence within the regional governing system.</p> <h2>China&rsquo;s rising presence in Antarctica and the Antarctic Treaty System</h2> <p>Since 1961, the <a href='https://ats.aq/e/antarctictreaty.html'>Treaty of Antarctica</a> has limited human activities on Antarctica to those for peaceful purposes and scientific enterprise. It prohibits any claims to sovereignty. The number of signatory nations has risen from the original 12 to 54, 29 of whom have consultative status, each of those 29 nations has veto power within the consensus-based decision-making process. The system worked quietly for decades, but is increasingly under strain as new members &mdash; especially China &mdash; seek new flexibility in their approach to a continent and ocean rich in untapped resources.</p><p>Several incidents over the last two years have raised suspicions. China built its fifth research base on Antarctica without completing the required environmental impact assessment. China and Russia have cooperated to delay the creation of new maritime protected areas designed to stop the poaching of krill. And China has proposed the creation of a &ldquo;Chinese management district&rdquo; near the eastern coast, an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometer where the presence of foreigners would be restricted. The proposal has been rejected, but there is no process for adjudication of treaty violations and no clear means of enforcing compliance.</p><p>These attempts to bend the Antarctic Treaty System away from transparency and commonly recognized rules for information-exchange and environmental protection are alarming. While these bases are officially for scientific and safety purposes, they could have military applications as well, including satellite tracking and communications. When elements of the treaty come up for revision in the 2040s, these facilities could be the basis for claims of mineral and other resource rights &mdash; and even territorial sovereignty. At the very least, it is clear that China seeks to be a leading player in Antarctic governance, and it is working to shape the Antarctica Treaty system to suit its national interests</p><h2>Disputed lands and waters</h2><p>Over the next thirty years, virtually the entire continent of Antarctica, as well as its surrounding waters, will be up for grabs. Seven nations have historic claims over Antarctic territory, some of them overlapping. The most problematic case is the conflicting claims of the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina. For decades, disputed British claims to the Falkland, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, off the southern tip of Argentina, have created regulatory problems, fed nationalist ire and led to war. As competition over scarce resources sharpens in the future, these disputes over several hundreds of thousands of square miles of fishing rights and seabed claims will demand resolution.</p><p>Faced with similar disputes over islands and maritime territorial rights in the South China Seas, China responded by unilaterally building islands, redrawing its boundaries and challenging the international community to stop it. If this attitude carries over to Antarctic disputes, Beijing could find local partners &mdash; Argentina in particular &mdash; quite willing to cooperate in building presence and capabilities that make territorial claims for both parties a fait accompli.</p> <h2>U.S. Strategy Going Forward</h2><p>The United States has not yet reacted to these alarming developments. The 2017 National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy omit Antarctica altogether. Obviously, Antarctica is far from U.S. shores, but in an era of emerging rivals, Washington cannot afford complacency.</p> <p>So what should the United States do? First, it should work more closely with its allies who have important national interests in a stable Antarctica. Australia is a close military and intelligence partner with significant interests in Antarctica and the wider Southern Ocean. Indeed, Australia historically claimed 42 percent of Antarctic territory.</p> <p>Another key partner is Chile, South America&rsquo;s wealthiest and most militarily capable nation and a reliable democratic partner on the world stage. Chile is seeking partnerships to improve safe access to Antarctic research bases and to protect the region from the rapid rise of commercial tourism and illegal fishing. China has expressed interest in laying submarine cables from Chile to Antarctica and improving Chilean infrastructure in the far south, with clear intent to improve its access and services in the region. The U.S. should engage Chile&rsquo;s scientific, business and government communities and promote bilateral investment and partnership in Chile&rsquo;s Antarctic endeavors. Washington should also ensure that whatever investments and agreements China may make in the far south do not compromise U.S. strategic interests. U.S. aircraft carriers routinely pass through the Strait of Magellan when transiting between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although Argentina and the U.S. are not currently as close as they&rsquo;ve been in the past, the strategic relevance of that relationship &mdash; especially given Argentina&rsquo;s attractiveness as a major partner for Beijing &mdash; should not be overlooked.</p> <p>As Washington continues to expand on the second pillar of the National Defense Strategy &mdash; building alliances and strategic partnerships &mdash; Australia, Chile and other U.S. allies such as the U.K. will be important enablers of a stable Antarctic future. Washington has come to grasp the gravity of the unfolding situation in the Arctic. Future iterations of the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and the Unified Command Plan should acknowledge the strategic importance of the other end of the globe and the risks posed by geostrategic competition there. Through more emphasis on its national interests, as well as working with its allies, the U.S. will demonstrate a more holistic approach to polar security in an era of great power competition.</p><hr/><p>Nilanthi Samaranayake directs the Strategy and Policy Analysis Program.

The ships, emblazoned with large red crosses, vividly represent an accelerating mobilization against the ongoing pandemic. Moreover, even as public trust in institutions declines, the ships&rsquo; deployments visibly connect one of the country&rsquo;s most well respected institutions &mdash; <a href='https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/07/22/survey-public-confidence-in-the-military-is-high-especially-among-older-generations/'>the military</a> &mdash; to a contingency response that has struggled to soothe national anxieties. Yet even as the deployments are important symbols of mass mobilization, their role in increasing healthcare capacity is likely very limited.</p><p><em>Context on Hospital Ships in COVID-19</em></p><p>Before considering the question of capacity, it is valuable to clarify two of the key limitations that <em>Comfort </em>and <em>Mercy </em>face in the aftermath of the White House announcement.</p><p>First, it is important to note that while the vessels<em> </em>are well-suited for scheduled humanitarian assistance missions, they are not always available for surge deployments. While <em>Mercy </em>was <a href='https://news.usni.org/2020/03/23/hospital-ship-mercy-leaves-san-diego-today-for-los-angeles'>underway from San Diego</a> in a matter of days, <a href='https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/18/817881133/u-s-navy-hospital-ships-to-deploy-to-new-york-west-coast'><em>Comfort </em>may need weeks</a> to transition from its scheduled maintenance period to a deployment. This means that at least one of the ships is not immediately available to alleviate local fears of overrun hospitals.</p><p>Second, the prospective deployments are best understood as adding general capacity to the local healthcare systems they will be supporting. The ships are not specially equipped to handle quarantined patients and are likely to help offset demand for other hospital needs in New York and the West Coast, instead of directly serving individuals sick with COVID-19. This is surely a valuable service &mdash; imagine the sudden emergence of a trauma center in downtown Manhattan &mdash; but does not add to the stockpile of some of the key capabilities hospitals are lacking, namely ventilators.</p><p><em>Increasing Capacity</em></p><p>It is difficult to understand exactly how hospital ships change the capacity challenges that coronavirus presents, and examples from past domestic deployments are only partially instructive. In the aftermath of September 11, USNS <em>Comfort</em> deployed to Manhattan to provide medical aid and humanitarian assistance through <a href='https://health.mil/News/Articles/2016/09/10/Bringing-Comfort-to-New-York-City'>Operation Noble Eagle</a>. <em>Comfort </em>also provided surge assistance after Hurricane Katrina, which <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/D0013414.A4.pdf'>CNA helped document</a>. What these and other responses have in common is the need to augment capacity in a defined geography, with demand somewhat static in the rest of the national system.</p><p>Those are not the same conditions facing the United States right now, where demand for medical capacity is rising across the country. This opens questions about resource allocation at a scale far wider than previous domestic deployments have needed to address.</p><p>Staffing is probably the most difficult example. The medical personnel who serve aboard hospital ships have to be pulled from somewhere, including shore-based DOD medical facilities, which are then likely backfilled by reservists or private providers. While hospital ships can increase the number of beds available to the overall healthcare system (about 1,000 per ship) and certainly increase the number of medical staff in a specific location, they are not ordinarily permanently manned and thus do not increase the overall quantity of healthcare workers in the national pool.</p><p>Think of it like musical chairs for medical personnel. In an acute crisis in a specific location, shifting personnel from, say, Baltimore to Miami to meet the need can be a huge boon. In the current situation, shifting personnel can risk burdening the shore institutions from which they are pulled, or from which their replacements are pulled. A hospital somewhere may end up with a missing provider at a time they cannot afford to lose one.</p><p>Observers should remain clear-eyed regarding the larger context of hospital ships in the story of this response; never in living memory have we had to assess the role of these assets against such a system-wide demand for capacity. Yet despite their modest contributions, the deployments of <em>Comfort</em> and<em> Mercy</em> remain important symbols of the seriousness of government&rsquo;s role in alleviating the pain caused by COVID-19 &mdash; only a handful of national crises have ever called upon these ships. Most of all, the addition of 1,000 beds to treat patients with other diseases or injuries will undoubtedly save lives in the few cities they serve.</p><hr/><p>Dr. Joshua Tallis is a research scientist with expertise in ocean security, polar affairs, and the role of naval operations in U.S. foreign policy.

   articleHTML:"<p>As the new coronavirus continues its march across the world, journalists and researchers have already debunked a number of false stories, but many more are likely to appear as the battle against the virus rages on. The term &ldquo;infodemic&rdquo; has caught on as a reference to the whirlwind of disinformation around COVID-19. While these stories have come from a variety of sources, Russian media and online trolls have been some of the most pernicious propagators. In addition to spreading disinformation about the U.S. and the West on state-run media and social networking sites, Russia may have covered up facts and engaged in false messaging to its own citizens.</p><p><strong>Domestic Messaging</strong></p><p>So far, Russia is reporting a very low number of coronavirus infections, even lower than the tiny country of Luxembourg, despite the fact that Russia has supposedly run a high number of tests. As of right now, the share of cases that turned up positive compared to the number of tests run is just 0.21 percent, which would be the world&rsquo;s second lowest (after the United Arab Emirates). While the number of cases in Russia is growing, and the country has imposed a number of restrictions &mdash; including closing all schools in Moscow &mdash; both experts and the Russian population are skeptical of officially reported numbers. A history of opacity and obfuscation during crises such as the nuclear accident in Chernobyl has led everyday Russians to be somewhat suspicious of messaging from their government in these situations. An unexplained jump in the number of pneumonia cases, which in Moscow rose 37 percent from the year before, has fueled apprehension. (The government in Moscow later walked those numbers back and stated that the number of cases actually fell.)</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin asserts that the situation in Russia is under control due to a number of measures the government implemented swiftly and early, including closing the border with China and setting up quarantine zones. Russia has also tested large numbers of people since February. However the test is run out of a single lab in Siberia, and evidence shows it is much less sensitive than tests administered in many other countries, which could lead to greatly distorted figures.</p><p>In reply to the skeptics, Putin has pointed to disinformation from abroad, stating Russia&rsquo;s adversaries are spreading false narratives about the coronavirus in Russia to cause panic among the Russian people. A Russian cybersecurity firm called Group-IB said in early March that it had uncovered thousands of posts on messaging services and social media sites like the Russian social networking site V Kontakte containing false information about the spread of coronavirus in Russia. As a result, the Russian communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, blocked access to a large number of posts it claimed contained disinformation, and even threatened to revoke the licenses of news outlets discovered to be distributing disinformation about the virus that &ldquo;sows panic&rdquo; among the Russian people. It also took aim at several news outlets propagating news it deemed fake and ordered those entities, including the radio station Echo Moskvy, to remove the offending content.</p><p><strong>Spreading Disinformation Abroad</strong></p><p>At the same time, Russia has promulgated false coronavirus narratives about the U.S. and the West through a multi-pronged effort playing out across state-run TV, radio, websites and social media. Since early February, theories that the U.S. and the West are intentionally responsible for the spread of coronavirus have featured prominently on Russian channels including Channel One, the state network that reaches the largest number of Russians. Stories alternately blame American intelligence agencies, pharmaceutical companies and billionaires &mdash; including Bill Gates and George Soros &mdash; for creating the virus. One news report went so far as to imply President Donald Trump&rsquo;s involvement in the creation of coronavirus, since &ldquo;corona&rdquo; means &ldquo;crown&rdquo; in both Latin and Russian, and Trump was previously involved in running beauty pageants. The use of traditional media to spread false narratives is reminiscent of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s &ldquo;active measures,&rdquo; a vast media ecosystem that the USSR used to advance disinformation both inside and outside its borders. An infamous example of this was the spread of a false story asserting the United States created the AIDS virus. While such stories could take years to make their way through the media web and into public consciousness during the Cold War, today&rsquo;s digitally connected world has greatly sped up the spread of disinformation.</p><p>In February, an unpublished report from the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s Global Engagement Center purported to show around two million Russia-linked tweets in a variety of languages pushing disinformation primarily about the U.S. and the origins of the coronavirus. An internal report from the European Union published on March 16 also linked a &ldquo;significant disinformation campaign&rdquo; to Russia, saying a monitoring team had uncovered around 80 examples of Russian disinformation over the previous two-month period. A number of these narratives also related to the manufacture of the virus by the West, pharmaceutical companies, or other entities like the Belarussian opposition. Other narratives took aim at EU member states in order to cause panic, such as the false claim that the Slovak prime minister had contracted coronavirus and infected other EU leaders during the Brussels summit in February. Moscow for its part, has strongly denied these reports, stating there is no evidence to back up the accusations.</p><p>Some of these stories had widespread distribution. For the two-month tracking period, the Spanish-language news service of the Russian government-funded television network, RT Spanish, was the 12th most read source for coronavirus news on social media sites, placing ahead of even some prominent Western news organizations.</p><p>Rather than writing posts themselves, those spreading Russian disinformation have primarily reposted and amplified the theories of others, including stories originating from China, Iran, and the American far right. This potentially allows Russia to fend off accusations that it is creating disinformation, by instead stating it is simply reporting on the statements of others. As is often the case with Russian disinformation, a multitude of different and often contradictory narratives are deployed without regard for whether a single idea actually sticks. The immediate aim is to confuse the public and elites, thereby subverting trust in national entities, eroding confidence in the ability of Western governments to respond to the crisis, and generally fostering panic around the globe. In the long term, this disinformation could play into a number of Russian strategic goals, including the eventual disintegration of trust in Western institutions and the liberal international order. Moscow hopes this disintegration will help restore Russia to great power status, preserve its sphere of influence, and bolster the regime.</p><hr/><p>Kasey Stricklin is a research analyst with CNA's Adversary Analytics team, where she is a member of the Russia Studies Program.

   articleHTML:"<p>In February 2006, CNA convened a conference of public health and government officials, medical experts and regional specialists to discuss the science and politics of pandemics, particularly as pertains to Asia. Two public health crises tied to Asia provided the impetus for hosting the event. The first was the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV. The second was the global public health crisis resulting from the 2005 reemergence of avian influenza, or H5N1, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;bird flu.&rdquo;</p><p>The conference was a sobering event. At the time, there was great concern that avian influenza had high potential to become the source of a global pandemic if it transformed to sustain human-to-human transmission. Consequently, a lot of discussion at the event focused on H5N1. In 2020, it is a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that we are confronting, not avian influenza, but some of the <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/D0016151.A4.pdf'>observations from that conference</a> a decade and a half ago are equally valid &mdash; and unnerving &mdash; in today&rsquo;s context.</p><p><strong>The ability to develop vaccines for a novel virus strain will generally lag behind the spread of the pandemic.</strong></p><p>At our 2006 conference, great concern was evinced about the challenges associated with developing an effective vaccine for a novel virus. As one medical specialist pointed out, &ldquo;Vaccine research &hellip; can only occur for viruses that exist, not for viruses that we fear have the potential to emerge. Therefore, efforts to develop a vaccine cannot even begin until after (the strain) has already mutated and an influenza pandemic has begun.&rdquo; This is certainly the case at the moment. U.S. government health officials have publicly cautioned that a safe, effective, and clinically tested vaccine for COVID-19 may not be ready for as many as eighteen months. The fears expressed at our 2006 event have been validated by the current absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, the lack of human immunity to this novel virus, and its easy human-to-human transmissibility in a hyper-globalized world.</p><p><strong>Political challenges posed by pandemics can hamper the ability of governments to deal with global health security emergencies.</strong></p><p>During our 2006 conference, one of the major non-medical takeaways was that domestic and international politics will be highly significant factors in determining how effective the early warning, containment, and response to future global pandemics will be. As summarized in the conference report, &ldquo;&hellip;the emergence of human pandemic flu is a question not just of biology and demography but also a question of transparency and international will.&rdquo; Transparency, cooperation, communication as well as public trust in government institutions were all cited in 2006 by conferees as critical.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2020 it is painfully apparent that domestic and international political factors early on constrained effective responses within and among many countries around the globe. Future histories of the political and international dimensions of &ldquo;the great pandemic of 2020&rdquo; will unquestionably convey some unpleasant findings as regards domestic governance, preparedness and responses within many countries, as well as cooperation among them.</p><p><strong>Asia in general &mdash; and China in particular &mdash; has high potential as a source of pandemics.</strong></p><p>Pandemics can emerge from many parts of the world. For example, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the swine flu pandemic of 2009 was first detected in the United States before spreading globally. Ebola and its 2014&ndash;2016 outbreak emerged from West Africa. CNA&rsquo;s event focused on Asia; the source of SARS and avian influenza. Asia was considered potentially problematic for a few reasons. First was the high population of domestically farmed ducks and pigs. (Pigs act as mixing vessels for strains of human and avian influenza.) Second, Asia is home to various migratory routes across which wild birds transit, with the potential to infect domestic flocks. Third, Asia has dense rural human populations that live in close contact with domestic poultry and pigs due to backyard farming. Specialists at the conference offered that these factors, while generic to Asia, are especially prevalent in China.</p><p>At the conference, Professor Yanzhong Huang of Seton Hall University &mdash; a ubiquitous commentator in the current crisis &mdash; highlighted that China&rsquo;s floating population of more than 200 million, by some approximations, would make disease control difficult should an outbreak occur. As it turned out, China&rsquo;s COVID-19 crisis took place in the lead-up to Spring Festival, starting January 25 and usually lasting about two weeks. This is the most important Chinese holiday, during which hundreds of millions travel. Before Beijing&rsquo;s January 23 ban on all travel to and from Wuhan, almost 5 million people are thought to have already left the city. Professor Huang also focused on political factors in China. He presciently opined back in 2006 that the combination of a lack of public accountability and oversight, as well as disincentives for local officials to report bad news, would hinder timely responses to a future notional pandemic centered in China.</p><p><strong>2006 Conference: Right prediction, wrong pathogen</strong></p><p>At the conference in 2006, experts were in strong agreement that sooner or later there would be another major pandemic. No one who attended that conference could possibly have left it without being more attuned to &mdash; or intimidated by &mdash; the prospect of what a major global health crisis would wreak in an age of increasing globalization. Most attendees also viewed H5N1 as a prime candidate for that next pandemic should it become more easily transmitted among humans. As we now know, that next great outbreak, the most disastrous since 1918, came from a SARS coronavirus.</p><p>In October 2007, not long after the CNA event, specialists in microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong published an article in <em>Clinical Microbiology Review</em>, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. Focused on the propensity of SARS to keep remerging, and looking back at the SARS epidemic of 2003, the authors wrote the following: &ldquo;Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel virus that caused the first major pandemic of the new millennium&hellip; the resumption of the wildlife market in southern China and the recent discovery of a very similar virus in horseshoe bats, bat SARS-CoV, suggested that SARS can return if conditions are fit for the introduction, mutation, amplification, and transmission of this dangerous virus&hellip;The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored.&rdquo;</p><hr/><p>David M.

   articleHTML:"<p>The spread of COVID-19 across the world is redefining the political and economic realities of every country on the planet. Every day sees scores of articles detailing how governments and populations are coping with the challenge. Yet when it comes to COVID-19 in North Korea, the Hermit Kingdom remains as difficult to read as ever.</p><p>Frankly, we don&rsquo;t know much about how the virus is affecting North Korea and its population. North Korea is notoriously opaque, and the reporting by its heavily curated official media outlets is frequently untruthful. Information on the actual situation in North Korea is scarce and unreliable. There are reports of increased food prices because of the shutdown of cross-border trade. Over 10,000 people were quarantined, though many have now been released. We know this because many of those were foreigners who reported on their experiences.</p><p>Other information consists of rumors that cannot be corroborated. There have been rumors of outbreaks of the illness among the military, but like other rumors emanating from North Korea, they are impossible to confirm.</p><p>We do know that the North Korean government took dramatic measures to counter the spread of the virus. Many of the steps taken rapidly in January parallel those taken when the country closed its borders during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. Pyongyang considers controlling epidemics to be a matter of national security, and the regime announced that it was implementing a &ldquo;national emergency anti-epidemic system&rdquo; for the country.</p><p>Public health crises are a critical threat to North Korea because its weak healthcare system has suffered from decades of dire mismanagement. Longstanding international sanctions have exacerbated this already emaciated system. Healthcare is not applied consistently across the population, and the regime is likely to direct medical supplies that do arrive in the country towards its supporters among the elites. Up to 40 percent of North Korea&rsquo;s population struggles with food insecurity under normal circumstances. This leads to undernourishment and increased vulnerability to disease. If a pandemic like COVID-19 were to break out among the population, the health care system would likely flounder completely.</p><p>The North Korean regime&rsquo;s initial response was rapid and forceful. While it does not excel at providing food or medicine to its population, it does have unique control over the movement of people and goods. Powerful security apparatuses and ubiquitous social surveillance are pillars of North Korean authoritarianism, but they are also useful tools for enforcing quarantines and lockdowns. By late January, foreign residents were placed under tighter movement restrictions, and everyone arriving from China was placed into a month of quarantine. Ultimately, North Korea barred all foreign tourism into the country and effectively closed its borders, allowing only a limited flow of goods that could be decontaminated. Pyongyang even increased scrutiny and punishments for cross-border smuggling, which it typically tolerates as a useful social and economic pressure valve.</p><p>Yet we can learn additional lessons from other developments during this time.</p><p>Naturally, North Korea took the opportunity to plead for an end to sanctions, claiming they are impeding the response &mdash; while simultaneously claiming no cases in the country. The idea of loosening sanctions gained some traction in the UN and in the international community, led by China and Russia. This could be an indicator that international will for sanctions is slipping. At the very least, it is an indicator that Beijing and Moscow are tiring of Washington&rsquo;s unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure campaign.</p><p>But North Korea&rsquo;s border closures create a more absolute economic embargo than sanctions could have ever hoped to achieve. That North Korea took such a drastic step illustrates that it is able to manage considerably more economic stress than the &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; policy has ever been able to impose.</p><p>North Korea&rsquo;s recent military activity is also telling. According to the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea, the North Korean military was &ldquo;locked down&rdquo; for February and early March. Not long after, Korean People&rsquo;s Army personnel were shown without facemasks and standing in tight formations inconsistent with social distancing recommendations. And after an unusually quiet period, the military set a record for the number of missile launches in a single month in March. Is this a risky projection of overconfidence, or does it suggest that North Korea successfully quarantined relevant units to eliminate the virus?</p><p>A similar question must be posed about the country&rsquo;s rubber-stamp legislative body, the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly, which is scheduled to convene on April 10. North Korea has announced that the assembly will meet to conduct necessary business. Some rumors suggest that representatives began arriving at isolated sites several weeks ago, allowing them to quarantine until the meeting. If the virus has not been contained, this could be a great risk to the personal health and safety of North Korea&rsquo;s elites. (Kim Jong Un himself is not expected to attend.) But if the assembly meets without incident, it may be another indicator of Pyongyang&rsquo;s ability to manage this crisis. We shall soon see how North Korea chooses to portray this event.</p><p>What we have not seen during the COVID crisis may be equally telling. Even accepting the regime&rsquo;s suppression of information, there is no evidence of mass social unrest. Nor is there evidence that the military or other national leaders are dissatisfied with Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s leadership during this time. Whatever degree of suffering the people of North Korea may be experiencing during the pandemic, it seems that Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s regime remains stable. That stability will likely shape Kim&rsquo;s policy towards the United States for the remainder of 2020.</p><hr/><p>Chris Steinitz directs the North Korea program at CNA, focusing on North Korean leadership, strategic calculus, and military operations.</p><p>The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CNA or any of its sponsors.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>Amid all the headlines about the COVID-19 pandemic, a notable development may have escaped the attention of observers. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun organized a <a href='https://mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32592/Foreign+Secretarys+Conference+Call+with+counterparts+from+IndoPacific+Countries'>conference call</a> with close allies and partners to discuss the crisis and ways to coordinate their responses. The call featured senior officials from the governments of India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam. The participants plan to meet in weekly conference calls.</p><p>Most of the populations in these countries are currently under lockdowns or stay-at-home orders. While the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold, it is important to recall another time when the U.S. and its close allies and partners conferred intensely after another black swan event with tremendous transnational effects: the December 26, 2004, Indian Ocean tsunami.</p><p>In the aftermath of an earthquake in the Indonesian archipelago, a tsunami swept through the region, killing more than 200,000 people, mostly in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Nations from around the world responded by providing disaster relief to the affected countries. The U.S. military conducted <a href='https://archive.defense.gov/home/features/tsunami/index.html'>Operation Unified Assistance</a> to deliver relief. The <a href='https://archive.defense.gov/home/photoessays/2005-02/p20050222a1.html'>USNS <em>Mercy</em></a>, which is <a href='/news/InDepth/article?ID=41'>currently operating</a> off the U.S. West Coast, was among the ships that participated in relief efforts.</p><p>This episode illustrated the critical importance of diplomatic cooperation and operational coordination when the U.S. works with its treaty allies and strategic partners. The U.S., India, Australia and Japan formed an active coordination group known as the Tsunami Core Group, run by senior diplomats from the four countries. CNA examined this crisis response coordination, particularly between the U.S. and India, in a 2014 study, <a href='/cna_files/pdf/DRM-2013-U-004941-Final2.pdf'><em>Improving U.S.-India HA/DR Coordination in the Indian Ocean</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Fifteen years later, the COVID-19 crisis presents operational differences with the tsunami relief efforts. There is no critical infrastructure damage around which militaries can focus relief efforts. However, there are some similarities at the strategic level. All four governments have considerable stakes in how they address this crisis within their own borders and how they demonstrate leadership in planning their overseas responses. At present, all are summoning the power of their <a href='https://news.defence.gov.au/national/daily-update-defence-response-covid-19'>militaries</a> in <a href='https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/03/18/commentary/japan-commentary/covid-19-strategic-shock-shakes-world/#.XoZCQ4hKhyw'>various</a> <a href='https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-iaf-transports-around-25-tonnes-of-medical-supplies-in-last-3-days-across-country-820128.html'>ways</a>. At the same time, all four are currently engaged in larger, strategic-level competition with China over the <a href='https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/minister/lreynolds/speeches/shangri-la-dialogue-2019'>rules and norms</a> in international politics and economy. Notably, Biegun&rsquo;s conference call did not include a representative from China, the source of the outbreak.</p><p>It is too early to tell if we are witnessing the beginning of a &ldquo;COVID Core Group.&rdquo; While the pandemic advances, we will need to track how diplomatic cooperation develops and to what extent these nations will activate response forces such as militaries for international assistance. Still, a few lessons from the Tsunami Core Group cooperation are relevant to the COVID-19 crisis response.</p><p>First, after banding together to address a transnational, non-traditional security crisis, the Tsunami Core Group members moved on to traditional security cooperation based on shared geopolitical interests and threat perceptions. The group laid the foundation for the <a href='https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/indian-ocean-rorschach-test-60178/'>Quadrilateral Security Dialogue</a> of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. In particular, the tsunami response advanced U.S.-India strategic relations by providing an example of how the bilateral defense relationship could function in operations. At the height of cooperation under the Quad grouping in 2007, the four countries participated in a naval exercise called MALABAR, which Beijing criticized as being focused on containing China.</p><p>Although this grouping eventually dissolved due to differing threat perceptions of China, the <a href='https://www.state.gov/u-s-australia-india-japan-consultations-the-quad-2/'>Quad consultations</a> have been resurrected in the past few years, even at the ministerial level. In September 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with counterparts from India, Australia and Japan. Will cooperation on the pandemic, another non-traditional security issue, intensify the geopolitical, traditional security cooperation between these democratic powers as they continue to view China&rsquo;s rise with concern?<br /><br /></p><p>The second takeaway from 2004 is that China was not a member of the Tsunami Core Group, nor did it provide significant relief assistance to affected countries. In 2004, however, China was not the economic and military powerhouse that it is today. Allies and partners coordinating on COVID-19 should consider opportunities to work with Beijing where useful. As Washington envisions a new era of <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf'>great-power competition</a> with China, there is <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/DIM-2019-U-021755-1Rev.pdf'>room for cooperation between competitors</a> as outlined in a recent CNA report and demonstrated in other non-traditional security experiences such as counterpiracy in the Gulf of Aden and the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. U.S.-China relations during the response to the pandemic will inform our understanding about the full spectrum of U.S. strategic options going forward in this era of great power competition.</p><p>The third lesson from the Tsunami Core Group is the clear value of allies and partners to U.S. crisis response operations. In addition to the former Tsunami Core Group countries, Biegun&rsquo;s call included South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam. The weekly meeting so far appears to have a regional focus, but long-standing, global U.S. allies such as <a href='https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/future-us-france-cooperation-think-indo-pacific/'>France</a> and the <a href='https://www.naval-technology.com/news/royal-navy-covid-19-pandemic/'>U.K</a>. should eventually be invited to participate. These countries are often conceived of in the transatlantic context, but they are close U.S. allies with global territories, responsibilities and operations. For its part, France is deploying two Mistral-class naval ships to the Caribbean and western Indian Ocean for COVID response under Operation R&eacute;silience. Meanwhile, the U.K. navy continues to maintain its overseas deployments and stands ready to deliver humanitarian assistance when requested.</p><p>As Biegun continues his diplomatic efforts and as the State Department has <a href='https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-is-leading-the-humanitarian-and-health-assistance-response-to-covid-19/'>announced</a> financial assistance to global partners, the time is ripe for the U.S. military to follow this lead through coordinated operations with other countries. While policymakers are understandably focused on mitigating the domestic crisis, the U.S. will soon need to demonstrate its ability as the leading global power to deliver relief when requested overseas. Although the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths are now in the advanced economies, the outbreak is expected to worsen in <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-developing-world-brazil-egypt-india-kenya-venezuela/2020/03/31/d52fe238-6d4f-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html'>developing countries</a>, which could quickly become overwhelmed. At present, six Indian navy ships are reportedly on standby to deliver relief to neighboring countries when requested, while the country remains on lockdown and Indian military services are responding domestically. Given the unknown trajectory of the pandemic, U.S. military officials should begin discussions with allied and partner counterparts such as India and France to explore options for coordinating operations.</p><hr/><p><em>Nilanthi Samaranayake directs the </em><a href='https://www.cna.org/centers/cna/sppp/spa/'><em>Strategy and Policy Analysis</em></a><em> program and studies non-traditional security issues affecting U.S. allies and partners globally.

   articleHTML:"<p>One day, when the full story is assembled of how COVID-19 spread from a localized illness to a global pandemic, we know that the plot will revolve around flight patterns. For this reason, governments around the world have risked using a blunt, painful instrument to try to stop the virus&rsquo;s spread: banning flights and flyers.</p><p>A complete analysis of complex flight patterns is invaluable to understanding and addressing a wide range of emergencies. And when the U.S. government has confronted natural and manmade disasters or national security crises, it repeatedly turned to CNA, a trusted analytical partner of the Federal Aviation Administration for nearly 30 years. In fact, the last time a coronavirus was in the news, in 2015, CNA completed an urgent request for the FAA&rsquo;s Office of Crisis Response and Emergency Operations. The group was tracking the possible spread of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS, via inbound flights to the United States. They needed a quick-turnaround report on all flights from the Republic of Korea to U.S. airports during May and June.</p><p>CNA first started working with the Federal Aviation Administration in 1991, analyzing the airspace over the United States. Congress had asked the FAA to determine the upper limits of the nation&rsquo;s capacity for commercial flights. CNA had to find the data to develop mathematical models to quantify the obstacles to growth.</p><p>Over the years, the FAA has continued to request more work from CNA. We were at the forefront of developing the initial flight-tracking database. CNA discovered that a gold mine of detailed air traffic data was collected and then routinely discarded if it wasn&rsquo;t needed for an incident investigation. CNA found a way to save the data, piece it together and organize it into a database for everyone to use. In those days, to upload 30 or 40 terabytes of &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; we literally had to load big magnetic storage devices onto trucks. That data is still used for post-operational analysis, 25 years later.</p><p>Flight pattern analysis can help in mitigating a wide range of natural disasters. The FAA recently asked CNA to help design and implement a monitoring dashboard to describe projected and historical operations for affected airports around potential hurricane paths for the 2019 season. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the FAA needed to know the number of flights usually departing, arriving and overflying the country. The FAA was deploying emergency air traffic radar services to the country, and the data would assist them with workforce and equipment planning. Following the eruption of a volcano in Iceland that same year, there was a dangerous amount of ash in the airspace over the North Atlantic and Europe. Flights had to be cancelled or severely rerouted. The FAA tasked CNA with analyzing historical traffic counts along the affected routes and identifying possible new routes depending on daily winds and jet stream patterns.</p><p>Understanding commercial flight patterns is also crucial to national security. At one point in time, CNA was asked to identify all Russian carriers that flew into or out of the United States or overflew U.S.-controlled airspace. The goal was to put a scope on the impact to U.S. and Russian carriers should a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; airspace restriction suddenly occur.</p><p>CNA also worked closely with the FAA when it needed several months of data for flights that came near North Korean airspace. The North Korean government had announced that due to military exercises, they could not &quot;guarantee the safety of any aircraft&quot; flying through their airspace.</p><p>In the months after 9/11, CNA was asked to help design two new security airspaces around Washington, DC: the Air Defense Identification Zone and the Flight Restricted Zone. Working closely with the FAA, CNA was tasked to make the zones large enough to give the military adequate response time for incoming aerial threats, but small enough to limit the impact on general aviation outside of DC.</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, a deep understanding of flight patterns is a capability that continues to be vitally necessary to the safety, security and health of Americans. And CNA analysts stand ready to address those needs with unbiased analysis and technical solutions.</p><hr/><p>Ashish Khatta has over 20 years&rsquo; experience supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as an IT professional.

   articleHTML:"<p>Prisons and jails throughout the country find themselves in an acute dilemma regarding the coronavirus. Without adequate testing of staff and inmates and with little experience with the virus, the immediate response is frequently lockdown. Key programs and routines that contributed to prison life &mdash; visitations, religious services, educational services, job programs, recreational activities &mdash; have been halted or downscaled dramatically for safety. But correctional leaders know that in the long run, this is an untenable situation.</p><p>Lengthy lockdowns and reductions in essential &mdash; and often legally mandated &mdash; programs and services run the risks of lawsuits and even destructive actions by prisoners. With little or no data to guide them, correctional leaders must make important decisions that will affect the spread of COVID-19 among their staff and inmates many times each day. Should certain movements be allowed? Can the staff hold a meeting? Should meals no longer be served in the mess hall? Should gym and workout facilities be closed?</p><p>CNA&rsquo;s Institute for Public Research (IPR) is developing a solution to help fill this knowledge gap. We are adapting a model recently developed by CNA&rsquo;s Fleet Operations and Assessment Program to simulate and predict the spread of the Coronavirus on Navy vessels. Our correctional facilities model, Simulation Applications for Forecasting Effective Responses in Corrections ( SAFER-C&trade;) tracks prisoners and staff on an individual basis, using the groups that each infected individual joins as the likely means of virus spread.</p><p>We are piloting and testing &nbsp;SAFER-C&trade; at a secure correctional facility in the Midwest. IPR staff have spent several weeks learning about the daily operations of the prison, particularly the living and working assignments for both staff and inmates, as well as their daily frequency of contact. With this information, along with COVID-19 data from the Centers for Disease Control, the model can project the number of infections and deaths among staff and prisoners. SAFER-C&trade; &nbsp;contains several sets of parameters that can be adjusted based on changes in prison operations, the number of staff or prisoners, the estimated frequency of contact between staff and prisoners in certain locations like the mess hall or yard, and more.</p><p>By running the model repeatedly, we develop a range of possible outcomes that can help correctional administrators as they make decisions in the pandemic. For example, they can better predict the impact of closing the mess hall and serving meals in prison cells, or of stopping or restarting education, work, visitation, or religious programs. With more information about potential outcomes from these decisions, the model will help correctional leaders identify lower-risk strategies for restoring some prison activities.</p><p>Soon, our SAFER-C&trade; will be out of initial piloting and testing phases, and CNA hopes to tailor the model for a jail in another state. The goal is a rapid rollout of the model to assist corrections facilities nationwide&mdash;because better-informed decisions are vital to the safety, security and health of the nation.</p><hr/><p>James &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; Coldren is a justice research expert with over 35 years of research experience in justice system effectiveness, police evaluation, crime prevention, corrections, juvenile justice and restorative justice.</p>"},

   articleHTML:"<p>At CNA&rsquo;s Institute of Public Research - Center for Justice Research and Innovation, officer and public safety is at the core of our mission. So we monitor emerging practices as law enforcement and the justice system respond to COVID-19. Agencies have moved quickly to implement a wide range of practices to protect personnel and the public during this pandemic. Some of these are stopgap measures that will have to be eased as the country eventually returns to normal, or at least a &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Other innovations have potential benefits that will merit close consideration and analysis as practices that could improve the justice system, even after the pandemic is behind us.</p><p>Business as usual is not an acceptable option for law enforcement. Nearly 20 percent of New York Police Department officers were out sick at the peak of the virus in early April. At least 37 <a href='https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/about/memorials/covid-19-memorial.page'>NYPD personnel have died</a> from COVID-19, including four patrol officers, five detectives, five school resource officers, eight traffic officers, six auxiliary officers and nine civilian employees. The National Police Foundation&rsquo;s COVID-19 <a href='https://pf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ef2bbd8c0b004455ae58305a143082d2'>Law Enforcement Impact Dashboard</a> reported in early April that 11 percent of officers from the participating agencies nationwide had been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, and seven percent were unable to work.</p><p>Many of the measures taken to protect law enforcement personnel are now familiar in workplaces globally: screening for symptoms and fevers before shifts, supplying facemasks and gloves. Of the 989 members of the International Association of Chiefs of Police who responded to a <a href='https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/IACP-GMU%20Survey.pdf' aria-invalid='true'>recent survey</a> conducted with George Mason University, 90 percent reported providing personal protective equipment for officers. But the concerns are familiar, too. Just 15 percent have full confidence they can maintain adequate supplies of protective gear.</p><p>Other measures address the unique needs of law enforcement, which had always relied upon physical interaction with the community. The survey found that 91 percent of agencies reported changing protocols for responding to calls for service. It also reported a variety of methods to reduce public interactions:</p><ul><li>Guidance to reduce arrests for minor offenses: 76%</li><li>Policies to reduce or limit proactive traffic or pedestrian stops: 61%</li><li>Training or guidance on maintaining social distancing when responding to calls: 57%</li><li>Responding to calls remotely and taking report remotely: 72%</li></ul><p>Dispatchers have new guidance regarding when officers need to respond and when to provide services remotely. Remote services include taking police reports for non-emergency incidents over the phone or via a web portal. Some 911 centers now take such calls, transferring them to another call center or directly connecting the caller to an officer to take reports or statements.</p><p>Many 911 centers also screen callers for people with potential COVID-19 symptoms at the response locations. Some dispatch centers have received address data from local health departments for confirmed COVID-19 cases. These addresses can be used to alert emergency responders to take extra precautions, but the information must be held under tight security. The sharing of such addresses is currently allowed in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Alabama, Florida, Minnesota and parts of North Carolina and Arizona.</p><p>Some changes could have positive, even long-term impacts. One agency told us that engaging with civilians around the COVID-19 pandemic has provided new opportunities for community engagement, fostering a &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in this together&rdquo; attitude. Now, efforts to reduce face-to-face contacts are spurring a large number of police departments to experiment with cutting back on stops for minor infractions, which may have the additional effect of reducing civilian complaints about nuisance stops by police.</p><p>Other innovative adaptations in prosecution offices and the courts are likely to continue as effective components of the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; These protective actions can even be a testbed for criminal justice reform measures. Reducing pre-trial incarceration and sentences is in line with current criminal justice reform efforts and is likely to continue. Remote hearings in the courts for have been discussed for years, but never previously enacted in many communities. Once the technology is in place, remote hearings will likely outlive the pandemic.</p><p>Necessity is indeed the mother of invention. This time of great necessity and great innovation in policing and justice will give the Center for Justice Research and Innovation issues to analyze for years to come.</p><hr/><p><em>Elliot&nbsp;Harkavy is an advisor with CNA&rsquo;s Center for Justice Research and Innovation</em></p>"},

   intro: "In the midst of a pandemic, the world is suddenly aware of scientists as communicators. The ability of public health and medical experts to convey the right message to the right audience at this moment is clearly a matter of life and death.",
   articleHTML:"<p>In the midst of a pandemic, the world is suddenly aware of scientists as communicators. The ability of public health and medical experts to convey the right message to the right audience at this moment is clearly a matter of life and death.</p>"+
   "<p>As a scientist who has spent decades learning how to communicate better with military leaders, this is a topic that I have come to see as crucially important to the work of my organization: providing technical and analytical advice that helps military and government agencies carry out their missions successfully. I am convinced that writing is an underappreciated tool for scientists. It is an integral part of the analytical process, not an add-on step when the analysis is complete. Writing is about thinking. By learning to write effectively, we not only make it possible for our analysis to have impact, we also improve our own analytical thinking process.</p>"+
   "<p>Thirty years ago, as a graduate student in chemistry, my approach was all about methods â hypothesis development, experiment design, lab technique. Writing was an afterthought. Yes, a dissertation would eventually have to be completed, but my energy and focus was on experiments and discovery. I now realize that approach made it a whole lot harder to pull my dissertation together than it needed to be. And it was even harder for anyone who had to read it. My lab results were great. But because I hadn't spent enough time thinking through what they meant, I couldn't communicate those results clearly to anyone outside of my narrow subdiscipline.</p>"+
   "<p>It wasn't until I joined CNA that the relationship between writing and really good analysis became clear to me. CNA runs a federally funded research and development center specializing in studies and analyses for the Department of the Navy, essentially producing a dissertation for every project. That's something on the order of 350 dissertation-sized reports per year, which I now oversee as the chief research officer. </p>"+ 
   "<p>When I was an analyst writing those reports, my research sponsors were mostly Marine Corps generals. I had to explain complicated stuff to very busy people who had decisions to make â important decisions that affected hundreds or even thousands of Marines. In that situation, every word takes on new meaning. Their need for clear, concise writing that answers their questions helped strengthen my own writing process. Getting to clear, concise writing isnât easy. Here's what works for me.</p>"+
   "<h3>Write early and write often.</h3>"+
   "<p>Writing helps me organize my thoughts, so I start writing from the very beginning of a project. Early on, that writing might focus on framing the problem and identifying the questions to address. As my work advances, the writing becomes more substantive â documenting data, methods and results. This writing helps me identify the key insights early so they can be tested, refined and polished. Just as important, crafting a story in sentences, paragraphs and chapters highlights weaknesses and gaps in the analysis. Writing clarifies my thinking. For example, as I'm writing up my methods, I sometimes I realize I have been making assumptions I didn't know I was making. So writing forces me to be transparent about my assumptions. And transparency is a hallmark of good work.</p>"+
   "<p>One caveat: I do not think that organizing your thoughts in the form of PowerPoint slides has the same effect. Pages of bullet-point lists don't help me see the holes in my work or expose hidden assumptions. And the reader might take away the wrong point. A slide deck can hide all sorts of lazy thinking that might otherwise be revealed as you write the story of your study. </p>"+
   "<h3>Share written updates regularly.</h3>"+
   "<p>As your work begins to unfold in your writing, don't keep it a secret. Let others read it. Most researchers at CNA send a memo of a few pages to their government or military project sponsor every couple of months and as often as every week. I find that even an update that addresses just one segment of the project helps mature my thinking, while providing a natural way to get feedback. This is an extension of the process of writing drafts â recommended in every treatise on writing. But by sharing those drafts, the benefits of writing early and often are magnified. I am rewarded with clearer thinking on the topic through the process of writing, as well as insight into the perspective of the reader.</p>"+
   "<h3>Pause, reflect and chop.</h3>"+
   "<p>As with a good wine, time can enhance good writing. One of the most important reasons to write early and often is that it allows you to revisit what you have written when your brain is fresh. Leaving your draft aside for a few hours, days or even weeks is the most reliable way to see your writing critically, as though someone else had written it. The more complicated the subject matter, the more important this is. While writing, I tend to be slogging through a tactical list of ten or more analytical results. After setting my words aside for a week or more to ferment, I can generally simplify the insights and pull out the essence of the work, the meaning revealed by all the various analytical steps and findings.</p>"+
   "<p>This is the time to add, cut, rewrite, and generally drain the red pen. Revising may be the hardest skill to learn in the writing process, but it is important. Critically reviewing my writing helps me identify potential weaknesses in my logic and holes in the story line. Seeing my thoughts on paper makes me realize how stupid â or amazing â they really are.</p>"+
   "<h3>Answer the right questions. </h3>"+
   "<p>For the decision-maker, I make sure that I answer four basic questions: </p>"+
   "<ul><li>What problem did I address?</li><li>What did my analysis say about that problem?</li><li>So what? What does that analysis mean for my audience? </li><li>What now? What should they do?</li></ul>"+
   "<p>You can't answer the most important of these questions â the \"So what?\" and the \"What now?\" â until youâve honestly considered who your audience is. I say \"honestly,\" because it's very common that writers subconsciously have a secret audience in the back of their minds. It could be the foremost expert in the field, your immediate boss or a long-dead thesis advisor. Your real audience probably has much less technical background than your imaginary audience, and is far less interested in things like the programming details of your model, underlying theory in the discipline, or challenges of data collection. </p>"+ 
   "<p>Writing for a decision-maker is different from writing for a technical audience. The decision-maker needs answers to those questions in as few pages as possible. The technical audience wants to know exactly what you did, how you did it, where you got the data, and all the underlying assumptions and caveats. I learned the hard way that I could only satisfy both audiences by writing two papers: a technical paper that completely documents the work, and from that, a summary of no more than ten pages providing the important information a decision-maker needs to move forward. </p>"+
   "<p>Writing is hard. Clear writing is very hard. But I've seen the processes described here permeate successfully into an organization of hundreds of scientists and analysts. And I have come to realize that writing well is more of a disciplined process than an intuitive art. Today more than ever, we see that science and analysis really matters to our global health and to the health of our globe. So we see that effective communication by researchers also matters.

   articleHTML:  
    "<p>The blanket dominance of great power competition as a guiding principle for U.S. foreign policy has emerged with breathtaking speed since the unveiling of the <a href=\"https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018 National Defense Strategy</a>. With the rise of this singular view of U.S. security goals, there has been a marked shift in how the U.S. government prioritizes foreign policy interests, articulates <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/01/21/how-to-read-the-2018-national-defense-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">strategy</a>, and divvies up <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2020/02/11/pentagon-budget-plan-emphasizes-great-power-competition-785234\" target=\"blank\">funding</a>. This swing has led to a hasty â and at times clumsy â repositioning of policy, as supporters give a great power 'spin' to diverse security issues in an attempt to remain relevant (and funded). </p>"+
    "<p>Real changes in global international affairs foreshadowed this shift, such as the extension of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/in-strategic-djibouti-a-microcosm-of-chinas-growing-foothold-in-africa/2019/12/29/a6e664ea-beab-11e9-a8b0-7ed8a0d5dc5d_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese military presence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-putin/putin-says-u-s-russia-relations-are-getting-worse-and-worse-idUSKCN1TE0L7\" target=\"_blank\">cooling relations</a> between the U.S. and Russia. But certain security issues should, and must, stand on their own in the competition to capture the attention of decision-makers. The current single-minded focus is reminiscent of the post-9/11 restructuring of national security priorities and the surge in counterterrorism-related programs. The pendulum has swung again, and great power competition has become the latest means of reframing issues that should actually be prioritized in their own right. The consequences of an overcorrection, such as significant cuts to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/acting-counterterrorism-center-head-fired-according-to-former-us-officials/2020/03/19/fb33d516-6a02-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Counterterrorism Center</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\" target=\"_blank\">federal preparedness for pandemics</a>, could significantly threaten our national security at home and abroad. </p>"+
    "<p>Security issues in Africa often rise to the attention of U.S. policymakers only when there is a crisis that captures the attention of special interests. Washington also pays attention when captivated by a major global issue like counterterrorism or â today â great power competition. But policymakers tend apply such concerns to the continent in a wholesale manner. There is room, however, for significantly more nuanced conversations around African security issues. And while the lens of great power competition can enhance understanding for some areas, it can obscure in others. </p>"+
    "<p>The risk of reframing everything as great power competition is that it undermines significant gains and remaining challenges that have little or nothing to do with China or Russia. For Africa, this includes a campaign of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/al-qaeda-islamic-state-sahel-west-africa/2020/02/21/7218bc50-536f-11ea-80ce-37a8d4266c09_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">terrorism in the Sahel</a>, piracy and partner capacity building in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48581197\" target=\"_blank\">Gulf of Guinea</a>, the uniquely severe impact of the <a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/regions/africa/regional-initiatives/responding-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">climate crisis on Africa</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-megacities-in-africa/av-51642291\" target=\"_blank\">rise of megacities</a>. Last month, the U.S. AFRICOM Commander, General Stephen Townsend, <a href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/video/742525/dod-officials-testify-national-security-challenges-middle-east-africa\" target=\"_blank\">testified</a> before the House Armed Services Committee about the risks of ignoring these growing threats. He cautioned that decreasing the U.S. counterterrorism footprint on the continent could have significant consequences, given the growth of al-Qaeda and Islamic State alliances in West Africa and the regional threat of al-Shabaab in the east. These security issues, which do not fit neatly into the great powers narrative, are at risk of being neglected or abandoned, potentially leading to tragic outcomes across the continent.</p>"+
    "<p>Painting the entire continent with the brush of great power competition can also reinforce the idea that Washington fails to see African nations and individual leaders as unique actors and equal partners. U.S. policymakers have long been accused of this kind of bias, treating Africa as a monolith and acting with limited understanding of the diverse security issues across its 54 countries. Grand narratives â and unsophisticated responses to them â can expose and reinforce these biases. For instance, publicly admonishing African partners for working with Chinese companies under unfavorable terms lends credence to the idea that Africa is yanked about in a tug of war between great powers. Though claims of exploitation by China are sometimes true, they unveil a bias in which the U.S. publicly extols a policy of partnership and mutual interests, while privately insisting that African nations toe the line. Further, it demonstrates an assumption that African leaders are blind victims of Chinaâs ambitions rather than actors who are themselves assessing how they will gain from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51092504\" target=\"_blank\">\"new scramble.\"</a></p>"+
    "<p>With consideration, planning and nuance, The United States can be smarter about how it articulates and applies the great power competition lens in Africa. Washington can use this pendulum swing as an opportunity to develop new relationships and priorities in emergent areas of strategic importance. But at the same time, the U.S. can avoid losing focus on those areas where great power competition does not play significant role, but great issues of national security do.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p><em>This article originally ran on <a href=\"https://www.38north.org/2020/05/csteinitzkgauseeyang050120/\" target=\"_blank\">38 North</a> on May 1, 2020.</em></p>"+
    "<p>Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public since April 11, feeding considerable speculation about his well-being and the future of the North Korean regime. Regardless of the rumors, recent events have exposed the fact that the outside world has given very little consideration to the matter of North Korean succession. Close examination reveals that Kim Jong Un's efforts to consolidate power and create decision space for himself as Supreme Leader also speak to the establishment of a continuity of governance plan. This may provide insight into what may happen should Kim Jong Un become incapacitated or die, now or in the future.</p>"+
    "<h3>Does Kim Jong Un Have a Succession Plan?</h3>"+
    "<p>There have been many takes over the past couple of weeks about who might seize control in North Korea in the event of Kim Jong Un's death or incapacitation. Yet, there is the less-explored issue of how power might be transferred from one leader to the next. Unlike the previous two turnovers of power, hereditary succession from father to son could not take place today. Kim Jong Un is rumored to have a son, but he would be much too young to possibly take over as Supreme Leader. Nor has there been a formal announcement of who might be next in line for the throne. Thus, without a clear heir, a continuity of governance plan would have to be constructed in the eventuality of Kim Jong Un becoming incapacitated or dying. But has Kim done this?</p>"+
    "<p>Any totalitarian leader must be careful about revealing too much about his plans for succession, so it is not surprising that we do not know about Kim Jong Un's succession plan. Still, there are signs that the regime is somewhat prepared for this eventuality. Derived from his long-standing efforts to build legitimacy and consolidate his power as Supreme Leader, it is likely that Kim has established some continuity of governance plan.</p>"+
    "<p>Since he first stepped onto the stage, Kim Jong Un has worked assiduously to earn his legitimacy as ruler. A third-generation leader, he lacked the political heft of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and had to generate his credibility through his actions and the success of his policies. As such, Kim needed a regime whose key actors followed his guidance and would not interfere in politics.</p>"+
    "<p>For the first few years of his reign, there was no obvious plan for continuity. While consolidating his power, Kim needed to be careful not to upset the power dynamics inside the regime too quickly by creating a potential second center of power. Throughout his rule, Kim has consistently worked to eliminate potential claimants to the throne, such as Jang Song Thaek and Kim Jong Nam, as well as weaken the military's political influence, the major claimant of resources under Kim Jong Il. In 2017, Kim began the process of reining in the ability of the powerful Organizational Guidance Department to play politics inside the regime. These actions were clear components of his efforts to consolidate his own power.</p>"+
    "<p>At the same time, these measures also suggest that a continuity of governance plan has been taking shape. While curbing traditional power actors within the regime, Kim has also enhanced the power of the Kim family and his personal apparatus. This represents a fundamental rewiring of how power operates in his regime, as opposed to his father's. While the power of formal leaders, like Choe Ryong Hae and Ri Man Gon, has waned, the political power of Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, has grown. She has represented the Supreme Leader abroad, and has received political positions in the Politburo, North Korea's highest organ of power. In recent months, she has demonstrated her growing influence through providing guidance to the military and making public pronouncements on economic and security policy.</p>"+
    "<p>The systematic rise and positioning of Kim Yo Jong signals the development of a continuity of governance plan, although the details of this plan remain unclear. It could be grooming her to be Supreme Leader, or ensuring that she plays a prominent leadership role, perhaps as a regent. What is clear is that by virtue of the responsibilities her brother has granted her, she will have a seat at the table and is likely to be the person responsible for protecting the Kim family equities.</p>"+
    "<p>It is also likely, however, that this plan will require several more years to complete. If something were to befall Kim in the near future, key stakeholders in the regime would be forced to determine the fate of the country. They would, however, be constrained by the arrangements he has already made. The following is how we expect the transition of power might play out.</p>"+
    "<h3>North Korean Continuity of Governance</h3>"+
    "<p>If Kim Jong Un were to fall seriously ill or die, where it happens and who has situational awareness makes all the difference. If it were to occur in public, the fallout would be hard to control and a power struggle would likely be inevitable. If it were to occur in private, however, those around Kim could begin to make preparations. Only a limited circle of players around Kim would have initial knowledge of the situation. This inner circle begins with his personal security detail and the Kim family.</p>"+
    "<ol><li>The Sixth Bureau of the General Guard Command (GGC) is in charge of Kim's personal security. They would be the first to know if anything has gone amiss at his personal offices, his residences or during travel inside and outside the country. This bureau has the authority to countermand any orders provided by the GGC, including issuing orders for them to stand down. It also has ties to Kim Yo Jong in her capacity as a gatekeeper for the Supreme Leader.</li>"+
    "<li>Key members of the Kim family, Kim Yo Jong and Ri Sol Ju, have daily contact and situational awareness of Kim Jong Un's whereabouts and movements, giving them great influence over how events unfold. Kim Yo Jong also has daily oversight of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, which controls the North Korean media. Other members of the Kim family, including Kim Pyong Il and Kim Jong Chol, would only have knowledge on an as-needed basis.</li>"+
    "<li>Aides such as Choe Ryong Hae and Ri Man Gon would receive information on the Leader's movements from Kimâs personal secretariat. The Organizational Guidance Department (OGD) ties into Kim's personal office, most likely through Kim Yo Jong and Jo Yong Won, Chief of Kim's personal secretariat, both of whom are directly loyal to Kim Jong Un. If there were updates of Kim's health situation, the OGD would likely hear from Kimâs office and then be responsible for spreading it to the wider leadership.</li>"+
    "<li>The military would not learn of Kim's health situation per se, although key command and control (C2) and information nodes would likely be activated early on to ensure a security lockdown and control of the armaments. The General Staff's Operations Bureau would be critical to ensuring command and control of the conventional forces. The Supreme Command would issue orders to the strategic forces.</li>"+
    "<li>In the past year, the heads of the GGC and the Ministry of People's Security have been replaced, as have the leadership of the Central Committee departments that control the reserve forces, such as the Red Guard. All of these organs would be critical in maintaining public order.</li>"+
    "<li>The counterintelligence forces inside the country, including the General Political Bureau, Ministry of State Security and the Military Security Command, would not necessarily have immediate knowledge of Kim's unfolding health situation, but all would be responsible for ensuring that the leadership remains loyal during the transition period. All three are currently headed by men with close ties to Kim Jong Un and the Kim family.</li></ol>"+
    "<p>If the leader were merely incapacitated, the immediate, temporary structure would likely be led by a small group of family and close aides, who would make decisions along established lines, maintaining the status quo. This small collective would carry out the day-to-day affairs of the regime, not unlike the group that supported Kim Jong Il after his stroke in 2008.</p>"+
    "<p>If Kim Jong Un dies, however, the situation would become much more precarious. An initial leadership group would likely be set up that includes those above, as well as members from the Party, military and internal security. Whether someone like Kim Yo Jong would sit atop this structure or would assume the role of Supreme Leader is unclear. It is also possible that some male member of the Kim family could be put forth as a figurehead for legitimacy purposes, instead of Kim Yo Jong.</p>"+
    "<p>The problem for any follow-on regime would be its lack of inherent legitimacy. The same challenge that defined Kim Jong Un's tenure for the first five years would resurface, but under crisis circumstances. Internal and external forces would exert great pressures on the new configuration of authority, which would face serious challenges to its unencumbered rule for much more than a few months. There is little doubt that a Congress or Conference of the Korea Workers' Party would be required to confer long-term legitimacy.</p>"+
    "<h3>More Reading of Tea Leaves</h3>"+
    "<p>In consolidating his power over the years, Kim's actions have directly and indirectly shaped the ability of his inner circle to manage such continuity of governance. There is no way to know exactly how these dynamics would play out but we can continue to monitor these organizational shifts inside the North Korean regime to be better prepared for the eventuality. Doing so will enable the Pyongyang-watching community to move beyond just speculating about Kim Jong Un's successor, and towards the consideration of realistic scenarios of succession.</p>"+

The experience will change how we think about business continuity in the post-pandemic period. But just because businesses are reopening does not mean business continuity practices can be set aside. Many of the ï¬exible strategies youâve employed to maintain operations will need to be continued during the recovery while the virus is still circulating. For example, take this time to revisit and update key policies related to employee sick leave, ï¬exible work arrangements, childcare options, and medical insurance coverage.

   intro: "While hobby wargaming has a plethora of outlets during this global pandemic, the same cannot be said for professional wargaming.",
   articleHTML: "<p>While hobby wargaming has a <a href=\"https://paxsims.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/wargaming-from-home/\">plethora of outlets</a> during this global pandemic, the same cannot be said for professional wargaming.</p>"+
   "<p>The pandemic has completely disrupted professional wargaming, which is typically played en masse and in person. Hundreds of people tend to gather for the signature \"Title 10\" wargames of each service, such as the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Warrior or the Navy's Global wargames. These events bring together the artists, scientists, and practitioners of military disciplines to practice, explore, and critique the newest concepts the U.S. military will face or bring to bear. But in the last three months, all of CNA's in-person wargames have been postponed or cancelled, and the larger military events have mostly been postponed, cancelled, or significantly scaled back.</p>"+
   "<p>In this time when virtual meetings are <a href=\"https://voltagecontrol.com/blog/so-all-meetings-just-become-virtual-meetings-lets-make-them-better/\">becoming the norm</a>, it may seem obvious to simply start running these wargames online. But shifting entire wargames to virtual events can never fully replace in-person events. A successful wargame is inherently a many-to-many conversation, in which disparate participants from a broad range of organizations gather to share their unique perspectives. Virtual platforms are not yet able to duplicate the experience. </p>"+
   "<p>But wargames are simply too critical to the national planning processes and to developing senior leaders for us to simply throw up our hands and wait for a COVID-19 vaccine. We must learn to execute virtual wargames that yield at least some of the same impact and insight. And so we have to reckon with their many challenges. </p>"+
   "<p>Reconstructing those many-to-many conversations is the largest challenge. A facilitator at the front of the room for an in-person wargame may guide and synthesize discussion points. But importantly the participants talk with each other. Whether strangers or colleagues, people sitting next to each other begin having a conversation; they share information relevant to the conduct of the game. Those conversations between people with interest or expertise in the topic build the collective knowledge of the room. Over the course of the hours or days of the wargame, each of those conversations is repeatedly combined, filtered, vetted and summarized through the minds in the room. The result has a chance to be a rarified nugget of insight, molded by every participant's tiny mote of knowledge about the same problem.</p>"+
   "<p>When it works well, it's beautiful to behold. But the management of that process is what makes wargame facilitation such a challenge, even with the advantages of in-person interactions. Designing a wargame to incorporate those interactions â and be flexible enough to leverage them â is part of the art of wargame design. And it is that challenge we designers now need to overcome in the virtual world.</p>"+
   "<p>In the time of COVID-19, wargamers no longer share thoughts over a cup of coffee and a flaky pastry in a room full of people. In virtual wargames on a videoconference platform, players sit at home with their laptops, watching wargame briefs. And â let's face it â reading their email, watching their kids, folding their laundry, or reading news on their phone.</p>"+
   "<p>Beyond those distractions, the biggest challenge is that virtual conferences are, at their heart, a one-to-many conversation. Virtual conferencing tools are a great way to present one person's ideas to a large group of people. They grow your audience, projecting your voice to people who would not otherwise be able to hear you in person. But when only one person can talk at a time, the many-to-many conversations that distinguish professional wargames are lost.</p>"+
   "<p>After the introductory briefs, a wargame facilitator knows they did their job well when the room erupts in conversations. Whether those voices are happy, sad, angry or excited, a good facilitator charges the players with energy to go forth and solve the problem at hand. And a good wargame design gives them a productive place to channel that collaborative energy.</p>"+
   "<p>That transfer of energy rarely happens in a virtual conference. The challenge for wargaming during COVID-19 is finding a way to stoke that energy, capture it within the bounds of the wargame, and focus it into productive work in support of the wargame problem.</p>"+
   "<p>For an in-person event, stoking this energy gets easier with more people in the room. Large numbers of people tend to self-organize, finding something productive to do so they won't be bored while trapped in a conference center for a week â usually without their cell phones. More people means more \"error correction.\" Participants can easily interject their corrections into the primary thread of the wargame by raising their hands, asking a question, or simply catching the ear of a facilitator during the break. They can also have their own internal \"errors\" corrected by a room full of subject matter experts.</p>"+
   "<p>In a virtual event, the formula is reversed. Keeping the number of players small helps maintain coherent focus by allowing all to see when someone is not participating. The larger the virtual group â whether on a chat room dialog or video screen â the fewer creative outlets individual participants have for their energy when the single line of discussion is not about their area of interest. When you fail to provide an outlet for an interested person, the wargame instantly loses value.</p>"+
   "<p>Enabling the text chat in a video conference buys us back some aspects of the many-to-many conversation, but it is still not quite there. The chat window is full of questions, insightful thoughts, and the occasional joke or snarky comment. That's great â and can be kept for posterity, which is a win for the wargame analystsÂ¬ â but paying full attention to the chat and the presentation at the same time is a skill few have mastered. </p>"+
   "<p>We need to experiment with allowing players to self-organize into breakout rooms to solve problems, but I have yet to find a platform for government systems that easily enables these. Platforms like Slack or Discord might get us there â if we can overcome security challenges and technology barriers for players. But we still have to find ways to keep breakout rooms from becoming isolated stovepipes of excellence. And wargame facilitators need a way to monitor them all to determine the right time for the game to move on to the next topic. The corporate world has been telecommuting for years. What lessons can we learn from the way multinational businesses function and interact? </p>"+
   "<p>We particularly need to find solutions to the conundrum of large virtual wargames. Ordinarily, the larger the virtual event, the more likely the teleconference system will limit side interactions by not showing the participant list, by removing the chat function, and by channeling questions to a single moderator. These restrictions allow the facilitator to keep order over the single thread of the discussion. But wargames are not about singular information delivery; they are about communal information collection. Wargames are not about trimming off the unwanted threads, they are about weaving disparate threads into a single narrative. </p>"+
   "<p>COVID-19 may confound live wargaming for many months to come. When stay-at-home orders first began, our wargame sponsors postponed their events a few weeks. But as awareness of the severity of the disease grew, the planned dates slid to the right more and more. Now, three months into this global challenge, wargame sponsors are increasingly accepting the new normal and asking the question: \"Can we do this virtually?\"</p>"+
   "<p>The answer cannot be \"No.\" Wargaming saves lives. As a community, we need to accept this reality and understand that it will be different. I donât yet know what the effective virtual wargames of the future will look like, but now is the time to experiment and try something new. Some will fail. And that has to be OK. After all, as wargamers, we know that failure is how we best learn to be better.</p>"+

   intro: "Military recruiting traditionally relies on crowded events like career fairs and prolonged, face-to-face interactions. How has the military recruited, shipped, and trained when traditional methods are no longer deemed safe by public health experts?",
   articleHTML: "<p>Military recruiting traditionally relies on crowded events like career fairs and prolonged, face-to-face interactions. How has the military recruited, shipped, and trained when traditional methods are no longer deemed safe by public health experts? Methods have changed, but are these new approaches working?</p>"+
   "<h3>Recruiting</h3>"+
   "<p>Military recruiting has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruiters rely on personal, one-on-one conversations to gauge potential recruits' aspirations and discuss how those aspirations can fit into the mission of their branch of the armed services. To maximize the chances of meeting their monthly targets, recruiters often rely on high-traffic locations such as malls or organized events at schools that give them the opportunity to interact with the greatest number of potential recruits.</p>"+
   "<p>However, social distancing and limitations on large gatherings brought on by COVID-19 have shuttered high schools, left malls empty, and severely limited recruiters ability to make use of the time-tested approach of face-to-face conversations. In many locations across the country, local health ordinances have forced the closure of recruiting stations. The cancellation of sports and other community events limits recruiters' ability to rely on the coaches and other adults that often help facilitate recruiter meetings with high schoolers. </p>"+
   "<p>In response, recruiters have pivoted to more modern, digital approaches that typically were viewed as secondary to face-to-face efforts. In recent months, recruiters have almost exclusively relied on phone calls and social media for their outreach. Since recruits have not been able to visit physical recruiting offices, many recruits are even digitally signing their enlistment contracts. Only recently, with some of the areas of the country re-opening, have traditional recruiting methods returned â at least in part.</p>"+
   "<p>Despite these new recruiting efforts, the number of new contracts fell noticeably over April, May and June. <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/06/30/changes-in-military-recruiting-may-endure-after-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\">Reports indicate</a> that Army enlistments fell to about half of their typical levels during the early stages of the pandemic, though they have moved back up to about 80% of mission targets in June. Still, the armed services have expressed optimism in their ability to meet year-end recruiting goals. The Marine Corps noted that it was ahead of schedule on contracts prior to the pandemic and was able to adjust sufficiently to the new environment to be on track to achieve its annual recruiting mission. The Navy has tapped into a reserve of prior recruits waiting in the Delayed Entry Program to keep up with shipping requirements and expects to meet its year-end goals.</p>"+
   "<h3>Shipping and Training</h3>"+
   "<p>COVID-19 has also complicated shipping and training of new recruits. The pandemic presents a particular challenge at boot camp. In normal times, each training depot would welcome hundreds or thousands of new recruits every few weeks, while housing them in shared barracks and training them in groups well beyond the CDC recommended limit of 10 people. The services have had to change this model in consideration of the health and safety of both recruits and training staff.</p>"+
   "<p>While the particular responses have varied across the services, the result has been fewer trainees and longer processing times. The Marine Corps has reduced recruit training capacity to allow for social distancing and provides nearby lodging where new arrivals to boot camp quarantine for 14 days â a costly burden. Shipping to Recruit Depot, Parris Island halted completely, leaving thousands of new Marines to idle in the Delayed Entry Program. The Marine Corps has also suspended the standard 10-day \"boot leave\" period that follows graduation from boot camp.</p>"+
   "<p>The Navy suspended shipping in late March for three weeks, followed by another six weeks of limited shipping. As a result, many of the new recruits that expected to ship during the spring were delayed until the summer. Like the Marine Corps, the Navy has limited its boot camp capacity and implemented the same mandatory pre-training quarantine, slowing the progress of new sailors. Still, the reliance on the Delayed Entry Program for meeting shipping goals means that the backlog of recruits awaiting training has fallen to about 80% of traditional levels.</p>"+
   "<h3>Going Forward</h3>"+
   "<p>The ability of the services to weather the storm depends on a number of near-term unknowns: </p>"+
   "<ul>"+
   "<li>How many contracts can be signed in the coming months?</li>"+
   "<li>How will the state of the economy evolve, and how will this impact recruiting and retention?</li>"+
   "<li>Will a second wave of coronavirus cases force new restrictions that would again limit recruiting and shipping? </li>"+
   "</ul>"+
   "<p>Another significant question â How has COVID-19 affected recruit quality? â cannot be answered for at least a year, when the performance and retention rates of servicemembers recruited under COVID-19 can finally be measured. In the interim, the militaryâs recruiting commands will continue to push forward, optimistic that they can adapt to these new challenges.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>The nation's interest in police reform has never been greater. Conversations that used to take place largely in government buildings and research institutions now permeate living rooms and social media. Those of us who have worked on these topics for many years are now in a position to share what we have learned about how the nation can improve policing practices and begin the critical, demanding task of rebuilding relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</p>"+
   "<p>Four elements are key to the success of reform in policing:</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Objective assessment.</strong> Communities must know that agencies are engaging in reform based on objective and fair assessments. These assessments are the starting point to identifying policies and practices with negative consequences for the community and determining how to address them.</p>"+
   "<p>For example, empirical data on racial disparities in traffic stops, citations, use of force, and complaints outcomes can inform an objective assessment. Engaging outside providers to perform independent, evidence-based assessments of policy and practice is more likely to result in legitimate, community-vetted findings and actionable recommendations. These assessments must include community perspectives; otherwise, reform efforts will fail to rebuild trust.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Accountability and transparency.</strong> Agencies must also commit to accountability and transparency at all stages of the reform process. Independent assessment results must be made openly and easily available to the public, including all recommendations made to the agency. Agencies should establish procedures for updating the community on their progress for each recommendation, ideally on a public website. Agencies and communities can also benefit from engaging an independent organization to monitor progress and assess compliance with recommendations.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Active community participation.</strong> The community must be actively engaged in policing reform. This requires commitment from both the agency and the community. The agency must commit to listening to the communityâs concerns and acknowledging how past actions have harmed community members. The community must commit to sharing their viewpoints honestly and working collaboratively toward improvements. This collaboration and honest engagement must be present throughout the reform process for reform to succeed.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Renewed focus and resources.</strong> Stakeholders at all levels and types of organizations must make reform a top priority in policing and dedicate the necessary resources to ensure complete engagement. Local governments should ensure sufficient funding for assessments and implementation of innovative, community-oriented policies and practices. States must promote legislation and requirements that incentivize reforms. And the federal government must lead the charge, establishing new, adequately funded programs, as well as renewing investment in successful reform efforts. Federal investment will ensure that reform is available to all communities, not just those that can afford it independently.</p>"+
   "<p>For effective and lasting police reform to emerge from this wave of national attention, all stakeholders â law enforcement professionals, researchers, analysts, community members, and government officials â need to commit to these four pillars. We can improve policing, public safety, and public trust, if we commit and work together. </p>"+

   intro: "Though the pandemic has upended organizations of all sizes across the globe, the U.S. military and its supporting agencies have proven surprisingly resilient.

   articleHTML: "<p>Though the pandemic has upended organizations of all sizes across the globe, the U.S. military and its supporting agencies have proven surprisingly resilient. Many have returned to normal operations or at least found ways to get the job done, five months after the crisis first hit the armed services.</p>"+
   "<p>Yes, the pandemic has proven a highly disruptive event, but not quite as much as many commentators anticipated in the spring. COVID-19 is no 9/11, which led to foreign invasions, decades of operations around the globe, and lasting transformation across the military and intelligence community. Likely pandemic impacts on the defense budget are trivial compared to the cost of the post-9/11 wars. </p>"+
   "<p>The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt went into quarantine in Guam early in the pandemic, but the U.S. Navy has otherwise maintained presence and deterrence in the Pacific, as have other U.S. forces stationed forward around the globe. There were disruptions to logistics and the global supply chain that sustain these forces, but ships and aircraft didn't run out of fuel or munitions and the tempo of their operations hardly slowed. There have been few casualties resulting from isolated outbreaks.</p>"+
   "<p>Senior leaders and decision-makers were forced to socially distance and many had to work from home. They ceased the constant travel and in-person meetings that make up a major part of their responsibilities. Decision-making and high-level deliberations were no doubt disrupted for a time and items on the agenda were pushed back or cancelled. But fortunately, there was no strategic surprise or other national security emergency during the late spring and early summer that might have stressed undermanned organizations or caught senior leaders unprepared. And deliberations and battle rhythms have since returned to near normal levels, as have patterns of activity across many headquarters organizations.</p>"+
   "<p>Many multilateral exercises have been cancelled or scaled down, reducing touchpoints with allied and partner forces around the world. Key leader engagements and other diplomatic activities have been cancelled or curtailed. Everyone is in the same boat, however. Reduced exercises are not indications of damaged relationships; they are just interactions put on hold that will one day resume. Some key leader engagements and diplomatic visits have started again already. And in some cases, U.S. diplomats and military leaders have shifted to virtual engagements.</p>"+
   "<p>Temporary reductions in recruitment, training and maintenance will no doubt affect the future readiness of some U.S. forces. Slow-downs in defense production will also hamper the equipping of these forces and the availability of major platforms like ships and aircraft. But these impacts are no more significant in the medium or long term than preexisting challenges to readiness and defense production. Other factors unrelated to the pandemic may in fact be more significant.</p>"+
   "<p>For example, more than a year of heavy U.S. deployments to the Middle East in support of maximum pressure against Iran have kept entire aircraft squadrons, carrier strike groups, and brigade combat teams from resting, refitting and training to compete with China and Russia. The tempo of operations in the Gulf and the alert status that these forces have maintained has drained more readiness from the U.S. military than 14-day quarantines or restrictions on travel. </p>"+
   "<p>Finally, all countries around the world are affected by the pandemic. No matter the impacts to U.S. forces and defense production, China and Russia have been impaired as well. Their defense production has slowed and both countries had to curtail interactions that might create a risk of outbreaks among their forces. This is important, because U.S. strategic advantage is measured in relative terms.</p>"+
   "<p>The pandemic is not over however, and this is no time to declare victory. There will be cause for concern if it becomes apparent that China or Russia have managed to come through the pandemic with fewer negative impacts. The difference will ultimately determine whether and how much the U.S. military will find itself in a less advantageous position in the future. If China or Russia are better able to weather the impacts, that may also signal something about their resiliency in the face of another pandemic. It may also presage their ability to overcome other unexpected challenges and perhaps even turn them to their advantage.</p>"+

Specifically, Pompeo indicated China has no lawful maritime claim over waters determined by the tribunal to be inside the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines or on its continental shelf. He called Beijing's harassment of Philippine fishing and offshore energy development activities \"unlawful\" and went on to identify other examples of China's illegal claims:</p>"+
   "<blockquote>United States rejects any PRC claim to waters beyond a 12-nautical mile territorial sea derived from islands it claims in the Spratly Islandsâ¦. As such, the United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Bruneiâs EEZ, and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia). Any PRC action to harass other statesâ fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters â or to carry out such activities unilaterally â is unlawful.</blockquote>"+
   "<p>This statement was followed the next day by a forceful speech in which Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell accused China of \"gangster tactics\" in the South China Sea. Why did all of this happen? Seemingly, this new policy approach had been in the works for some time, but it was rolled out this summer because of blatantly aggressive Chinese activity in the South China Sea early this year, coupled with a series of gross misrepresentations of <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/us-un-ambassador-pushes-back-on-chinese-south-china-sea-claims/\" target=\"_blank\">international law</a> as it applies to the South China Sea made by Beijing in the United Nations. </p>"+
   "<p>What did Washington hope to accomplish? First, it was throwing its weight behind the claims of its Southeast Asian allies and partners in upholding their legitimate sovereign rights created by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). These rights were reaffirmed and clarified by the July 2016 tribunal findings â and  were being dismissed by China in the UN.</p>"+
   "<p>The second objective was to clarify that the United States does take sides on maritime claims. Too often over the past ten years, Washington failed to differentiate between the policy of taking no position on âsovereignty claimsâ versus taking a position on illegal claims to maritime rights. Pompeoâs policy statement is not about who has sovereignty over the approximately 180 named islands, rocks, shoals, sandbanks, reefs and cays above water at high tide in the South China Sea. It is about water and ocean resources. The long-held U.S. policy of not taking sides in sovereignty disputes over the land features remains in place. In short, the PRC should stop trying to assume jurisdiction over waters that do not belong to them.</p>"+
   "<p>In practice, Pompeoâs statement also means the United States does not support Chinaâs claims to âhistorical rightsâ to the fish, hydrocarbons, and other resources in the South China Sea; a claim Beijing officially announced in July 2016. Unfortunately for China, the arbitral tribunal found the country had no such historical rights. Even if they ever had any, which the panel doubted, they were surrendered when Beijing signed the UNCLOS treaty. In short, Chinaâs âhistorical rightsâ claim was illegal, because, among other things, it grossly infringed on the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. China ignores this legal inconvenience and uses its coast guard and maritime militia to bully its South China Sea neighbors whenever they attempt to harvest the ocean resources that international law assigns to them. While China has not said so explicitly,  its heavy-handed practices make clear it believes its historical rights claim applies to the water area inside of the so-called ânine-dash line,â a U-shaped curve drawn on Chinese nautical charts. </p>"+
   "<p>The third objective was to clarify that while Washington takes no sides on sovereignty disputes over land that can be claimed, it does take a position on sovereignty claims over areas that no country can lawfully claim. Specifically, Beijing claims sovereignty over underwater features such as Macclesfield Bank or James Shoal that are submerged even at low tide. This is illegal. It is also illegal to claim ââto appropriate,â in the language of the UNCLOS treaty â features that are above water only at low tide. China has claimed and occupied such âlow-tide elevations,â even building large bases on Subi and Mischief Reefs. UNCLOS expressly prohibits such appropriation, and states that low tide elevations possess no territorial sea or EEZ. </p>"+
   "<p>A fourth objective was to adopt as its own the Obama administrationâs hard line against military base development on Scarborough Shoal. In early 2016, Scarborough Shoal suddenly became a new issue of serious concern for U.S. officials, because information strongly suggested the Peopleâs Liberation Army was making plans to turn the 150-square-kilometer shoal and lagoon into another artificial island, similar to their earlier island-building in the Spratlys. Whether this was Chinaâs intent is uncertain, but Obama administration officials reacted as though they thought it was and mounted a full-court press aimed at dissuading Beijing from developing Scarborough. A small task force of U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft was rotationally deployed to the Philippines, and USS John Stennis Carrier Strike Group conducted presence operations in the South China Sea for much of March, April and May of 2016. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/business/economy/trump-sanctions-south-china-sea.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Pompeo and Stilwell statements</a> make clear that the Trump administration also recognizes the destabilizing impact of any attempt to turn Scarborough into an air-capable base. In response to a question, Stilwell made it clear that if China were to physically occupy, reclaim or militarize Scarborough, Washington would consider that a very dangerous step, with lasting and severe consequences for Beijingâs relationship with Washington.</p>"+
   "<p>Finally, in the category of âbetter late than never,â for the first time Washington employed coercive measures in response to Beijingâs sustained, illegal South China Sea activities. In late August, 24 Chinese companies that were involved in building island bases in the South China Sea during both the Obama and Trump administrations were placed on the so-called âentity list,â prohibiting them from buying U.S. technology or other products. The government also announced U.S. visa restrictions on Chinese individuals associated with these firms.</p>"+
   "<p>In conclusion, these recent steps have been a necessary clarification n of U.S. policy in response to Chinese behavior in the South China Sea. But Beijing still has a great deal of unfinished business in the South China Sea. China is not alone in the Spratly Islands; it still believes it has get the Filipinos, Vietnamese and Malaysians off the 40 or so features they occupy in the Spratlys â without starting a war. It still wants to exploit the resources of the Philippinesâ Reed Bank. It still wants to turn Scarborough Shoal into a base so it can complete a network of air bases to control all of the South China Sea airspace in times of conflict. Finally, it hopes to persuade the government of the Philippines to cancel the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the United States in order to diminish the prospect of U.S. air power returning to the Philippines. These Chinese ambitions raise unanswered questions. Most importantly, what actions â if any â will the United States take, should Beijing continue to âslap aroundâ its South China Sea neighbors, ignoring Washingtonâs diplomatic and economic interventions?</p>"+

   intro: "When Yoshihide Suga succeeded Shinzo Abe as Japanâs prime minister on September 14, many observers anticipated a shift in the governmentâs focus. But global challenges and choices will soon demand his attention. Will he be pulled in two directions? ",
   articleHTML: "<p>When Yoshihide Suga succeeded Shinzo Abe as Japanâs prime minister on September 14, many observers anticipated a shift in the governmentâs focus. Abe had forged his legacy over nearly eight years with an assertive, defense-centric foreign policy and the transformation of Japanâs national security policy. Suga, in contrast, is known for his expertise in domestic policy and might be expected to turn inward to tackle serious problems at home. But global challenges and choices will soon demand his attention. Will he be pulled in two directions? </p>"+
   "<p>Certainly, Japanâs domestic situation needs a leader with Sugaâs experience. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 28% in the AprilâJune quarter. His low-key, unobtrusive and dutiful role as Abeâs right-hand man â the longest-serving Chief Cabinet Secretary in Japanese history â has proven Suga incomparable when it comes to managing and deftly orchestrating the vast and powerful Japanese bureaucracy.</p>"+
   "<p>Suga has already signaled his reform agenda. His initial proclamations indicate his focus areas are to accelerate domestic economic stimulus plans and to âpush ahead with deregulation and put an end to ministry sectionalism, vested interests and the practice of blindly following past precedents.â His Cabinet reflects a complementary blend of experience and new ideas. He retained Taro Aso (deputy prime minister and finance minister) and appointed Abeâs brother, Nobuo Kishi (defense minister), Toshimitsu Motegi (foreign minister), and Abeâs former foreign minister and recent defense minister, Taro Kono, as minister for administrative reform â one of Sugaâs pet policy issues.</p>"+
   "<p>Aside from domestic economic issues, national security and foreign policy challenges loom ahead from a surging, economically muscular, and militarily assertive China and a suspiciously quiet North Korea. Will Suga continue increased defense budgets and other national security initiatives begun under Abe?</p>"+
   "<p>Difficult challenges remain which include missile and nuclear threats emanating from North Korea and increasing Chinese military incursions into Japanese national airspace and territorial waters. Compounding these challenges is the strategic distrust between the United States and China that has reached an all-time low at a time when Japan and the U.S. are redefining the 60-year-old alliance. </p>"+
   "<p>Suga will have to make critical choices in this environment. Reportedly, his government is revisiting the debate for defense options that may envision blending its traditional defensive posture with a potential complement of strike capabilities. Moreover, Japan must contemplate investments in the future dimensions of the 21st century battlespace â in the cyber, space, and electromagnetic domains. All of these choices will involve hefty costs in a time of fiscal austerity. </p>"+
   "<p>But Sugaâs domestic and international objectives do not have to be mutually exclusive policy vectors. Japan is already forging ahead with closer regional ties in the Indo-Pacific Quadrilateral Security Dialogue â the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan security and defense federation. At the same time, the U.S.-Japan Alliance faces an opportunity to re-invigorate and synchronize strategic bilateral objectives. These, along with multilateral initiatives with South and Southeast Asia, could and should be enabled by a full complement of comprehensive trade, commerce, and economic policies as well as advanced technology cooperation in a consortium of âlike-mindedâ advanced technology nations. By seeking connective and overlapping complementary policy initiatives, the U.S and Japan can shape an alliance that addresses strategic challenges both abroad and at home. </p>"+

   intro: "The Future of Defense Task Force of the House Armed Services Committee recently released an ambitious roadmap to prepare the U.S. Department of Defense for the battlefield of the future. Their recommendations will require a tectonic shift â inside a gigantic, risk-averse bureaucracy. Here are three âmust-dosâ that might make that shift possible.",
   articleHTML: "<p><a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/2020/9/future-of-defense-task-force-releases-final-report\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of Defense Task Force</a> of the House Armed Services Committee recently released an ambitious roadmap to prepare the U.S. Department of Defense for the battlefield of the future. The task forceâs recommendations will require a tectonic shift â inside a gigantic, risk-averse bureaucracy. As the director of <a href=\"https://www.cna.org/centers/cna/ow/orgs-roles-missions\" target=\"_blank\">CNAâs Organizations, Roles, and Missions program</a>, I have led teams to support many DOD organizations as they transformed their operations, including the standup of the U.S. Space Force. This work has led us to three âmust-dosâ to achieve transformational change, three strategies that might make that tectonic shift possible.  </p>"+
   "<p><strong>1. Ground your vision.</strong> The Defense Department is unlikely to achieve alignment that will âbetter match national resources to next-generation threatsâ unless leaders can first define precisely what that looks like â functionally. Describing structural goals like âintegrate two commandsâ or âstand up a fusion centerâ can lead to outcomes other than those envisioned. My team supported a number of DOD organizations faced with a congressional directive to cut 25% of their staff. With only a structural target, most of the organizations we observed tried to âpeanut butter spreadâ the cuts, resulting in <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2016/08/right-ends-wrong-means-what-congress-is-missing-on-defense-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">fewer people trying to do the same work</a>, the same way, with less help. This did not meet the likely intent of Congress â efficiency â because the goal provided was a structural one, not a functional one. McKinsey & Company consultants have identified a lack of a clear goal as a key contributor to failed reorganizations.</p>"+
   "<p>We had to relearn that lesson with our plan for the Space Force. In 2018, Congress directed DOD to contract a federally funded research and development center to plan for a Department of the Space Force. CNA was selected for the project, and we began trying to design based on the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2810/text\" target=\"_blank\">National Defense Authorization Act</a>âs meagre structural description of the Space Force, just 21 words! A couple of months later, we briefed our progress to then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan. Just 10 minutes into the brief, he stopped us. The former high school football player asked us what his â50 meter time needed to be.â He wanted specific, measurable descriptions of the required performance of the Space Force to drive the design. We had focused on the structure requested by Congress, without fully defining how it needed to function. </p>"+
   "<p>We started again by asking, âWhat are we building a Space Force to do?â This began with the two things a Department of the Space Force needed to achieve from a functional perspective: meet national security space objectives and operate effectively as a military department. From there we deconstructed both of those targets into more detailed, measurable outcomes, comparing DOD performance at the time with benchmarks the Space Force should meet. Grounding the vision is essential, but itâs hard work. It took our team of a dozen experts four months transform those 21 words into objectives and outcomes that defined what a successful Space Force needed to do.</p>"+
   "<p>Does the Future of Defense Task Force report help the DOD to ground their vision? Sometimes. For example,  the task force aptly envisions the Departments of State and Defense sharing influence and leadership within a revised national security structure. It also acknowledges the need for further steps to figure out what this means and how it should be achieved. But their report also suggests an explicitly structural solution to problems of supply chain reliability: a National Supply Chain Intelligence Center.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>2. Be bold â selectively.</strong> Even transformational change needs to be done in discrete and selective chunks. We have found it useful to target areas that seem most primed for change. Acquisitions was an area that fit that description when we were looking at where to truly modernize the DODâs newest service to meet national security space objectives. Congressional and Pentagon leadership were already looking for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/12/27/six-things-on-the-pentagons-2019-acquisition-reform-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\">alternatives</a> to the traditional, rigid set of steps and approvals for acquisitions, ideas such as empowering decision-making at lower levels. Personnel was another area where Congress and the Armed Services were starting to experiment with <a href=\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/08/22/congress-navy-revolutionize-officer-promotions/\" target=\"_blank\">new models</a> for career progression and entry requirements. So our Space Force plan incorporated bold changes in acquisition and personnel management policies and processes. Indeed, these are <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-force-to-propose-personnel-reforms-to-attract-tech-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/space/2020/05/21/space-force-lays-out-acquisitions-reforms-in-new-report/\" target=\"_blank\">areas</a> Space Force leaders are now exploring, which they hope will serve as a model for broader transformation inside the DOD. </p>"+
   "<p>Itâs equally useful to know which aspects of an organization are rigidly resistant to change. As specified by Congress, our plan for the Space Force created a new military department, with its own civilian secretary and military chief. But as time went on, many members of Congress suggested that creating a whole new military department would add excessive bureaucracy. So instead, the U.S. Space Force was created as a new military service under an existing military department, the Air Force. (Just as the Marine Corps exists as a service under the Department of the Navy.) Where conditions are not ripe for bold transformations, compromise is the best path forward. </p>"+
   "<p>The report of the Future of Defense Task Force includes 14 separate recommendations â on topics as diverse as acquisition, funding, diplomatic agreements and partnerships, and public-private relationships. Each of these should be examined to determine where political leaders and national security institutions would be most amenable to dramatic change. This can help inform the order in which the recommendations should be tackled. </p>"+
   "<p><strong>3.  Make the transformational familiar.</strong> Big, sweeping changes are scary. People will worry there wonât be a place for them in the new organization or that it will be too hard to learn the new way. The task force acknowledges these headwinds, describing the âcultural resistanceâ to wider adoption of artificial intelligence in DOD systems and processes, for example.</p>"+
   "<p>The most effective transformation plans show people how they fit into the new structure and allay the fears of resistant groups by giving them some sort of comfort blanket. One method is to note precedents, where others have successfully traveled a similar path. In our Space Force design, we described somewhat unusual structures and approaches, such as making Space Force organizations tenants on bases owned by other military services to minimize headquarters overhead. But we also described where tenancy is already working today in defense agencies. </p>"+
   "<p>The Future of Defense Task Force report does take this approach at times. For example, it likens their proposed national campaign to win the artificial intelligence race to the familiar â if ambitious â Manhattan Project. Their recommendation for more seamless cooperation between the Departments of Defense and State could be made more familiar by drawing parallels with previous collaborations in disaster response.</p>"+
   "<p>Leaders also need to help all participants translate between familiar and transformed structures, for example by using old and new terms side-by-side. Essentially, they should provide a âdecoder ringâ to help people understand how to work with the transformed organization. The design of the Office of the Chief of Space Operations borrows more heavily from corporate models than from traditional military organizations. But each military function can be loosely mapped to the structure. So the new structure can easily integrate with other military organizations through a common functional language.</p>"+
   "<p>By grounding their vision, being selectively bold, and making the transformational familiar, DOD leadership has a starting point for successful transformation of the kind envisioned by the Future of Defense Task Force. None of these approaches is easy. But the larger and more bureaucratic the organization, the more essential it is remove roadblocks to change. Winning on the battlefield of the future will first require winning the battle to remake the Department of Defense. </p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>As the 2020 U.S. presidential election draws near, memories of Russiaâs interference in the 2016 election loom large. U.S. voters passed through the last election cycle largely unaware of Moscowâs extensive use of social media to spread disinformation and create divisive content, and learned of this manipulation long after they had cast their ballots. However, social media companies, policymakers, and the intelligence community headed into 2020 with much greater clarity about the threat Russian disinformation poses and the forms it can take. </p>"+
   "<p>Russian disinformation has not let up since the last election ended. In September, FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia is endeavoring to influence the U.S. presidential elections and is âvery, very activeâ on social media and its state-run media, as well as through other proxies. This may sound like dÃ©jÃ  vu â and, indeed, many of the disinformation narratives draw on similar themes from the 2016 election â but Russia is also evolving and adapting its tactics to avoid detection amid heightened awareness of its previous operations. </p>"+
   "<p>For a time, Russian actors largely had free rein to spread their disinformation by creating large numbers of fake accounts and promulgating a large quantity of divisive contact. Today, social media platforms and the U.S. government are much better informed about Russian tactics and have implemented a number of safeguards. Thus, to hide its hand and avoid rapid takedowns of its accounts and posts, Russia has had to evolve and experiment with new ways of spreading its narratives:</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Employing real people.</strong> In 2016, Russia used trolls, bots and other proxies primarily located in Russia itself to spread disinformation and generate divisive content. Social media platforms have become more adept at taking down accounts traced to Russia, so Moscow has increasingly begun to employ real people in targeted or other countries to knowingly or unknowingly spread Russiaâs narratives on its behalf. This helps Russia avoid the obvious signs of fake accounts that have led to quick account deactivations in the past. As Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory stated, âHiring people who are fluent in the language and culture avoids the kind of tells that can expose an operation.â </p>"+
   "<p>In October 2019, Facebook took down a Russia-based information operation that employed real Africans to post Russian propaganda and disinformation within African countries. The Russians even used some hacked Facebook accounts that had previously belonged to real people. More recently, the bogus news site Peace Data employed Ghanaian activists to write content targeting Black communities in the U.S. and hired freelance writers in the West to post articles espousing a far-left point of view. These writers did not appear to know that Peace Data was based in Russia. Facebook deactivated the siteâs social media accounts in September. This recent approach also shows the Russians are focusing less on spreading wholly made-up disinformation and more on sponsoring opinion articles written to generate shares, stir emotions, and cause division.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Using artificial intelligence.</strong> Previously, many Russian accounts had no profile picture or copped profile pictures from the internet. These were easily traceable with a reverse image search. By contrast, accounts set up for the people purporting to operate the Peace Data site used profile pictures generated by artificial intelligence. Those behind Russian influence operations now have the ability to use machine learning to further obscure the foreign origin of their efforts. These images are much harder to identify as fake, as they will not come up with any results in a reverse image search and require a close scan to spot subtle signs of AI generation. While telltale signs of AI use still exist, these indicators will likely continue to become more subtle or disappear completely as technology advances.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Creating fewer but more elaborate and focused accounts.</strong> Leading up to the 2016 election, Russian actors created thousands of fake accounts as they attempted to build a huge following and reach large numbers of potential voters. Because they created such a large volume of profiles, they put little work into fleshing out the supposed userâs biography and history of each individual account and making them appear more authentically human. Now, as awareness has grown of how to spot these fake accounts, the Russians have focused instead on creating a smaller number of accounts with more carefully crafted fake personas. In addition to the AI-generated profile pictures, operators have put more effort into creating a robust social media presence for these accounts. </p>"+
   "<p>Those behind the Peace Data operation created just 13 fake accounts and two Facebook pages, but they also created a presence across several different sites for their fake personas. They engaged with a more targeted set of users, rather than trying to spread their narratives as wide and far as possible. The Peace Data operation seemed to focus on left-leaning Democratic Socialists, environmentalists and progressive Democrats, whom they hoped to persuade to break from the establishment Democratic Party. Another recently-seen Russian tactic for avoiding detection is the creation of âburnerâ accounts, used to post single pieces of disinformation on social media and then promptly abandoned.</p>"+
   "<p>Despite advances in Russian tactics since the last presidential election, their efforts are not guaranteed to succeed. The Peace Data operation at the time of its detection had attracted only 200 followers to its main Facebook page after four months in existence. Even some of those followers were possibly fake accounts. </p>"+
   "<p>Overall, though, disinformation has proven a cheap and low-risk method for Russia to further some of its objectives.  Even the mere awareness that Russia has engaged in election interference and could do so again aids Moscow in its objective of appearing to be â and ultimately becoming â a great power with the ability to affect global affairs. It is thus highly likely Russiaâs methods will continue to evolve and adapt beyond this current election cycle and into the future.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>As the United States and India conclude the third 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue this week, the results emerging from these meetings are notable, not just because of their substance, but because of their timing. The two countries completed a defense agreement that has been well over a decade in the making and affirmed a series of other promising military collaborations. The fact that such progress comes in the last months of a U.S. presidential term suggests that for New Delhi, these advances are not primarily intended to curry favor with the White House â as has been past practice â but spring from a genuine desire to enhance military cooperation with the United States. Concerns about China appear to have driven India to finally get serious about its defense partnership with the United States.</p>"+
   "<p>The U.S.-India defense relationship continues to be the central pillar of the 2+2 dialogues, as was intended from the start of these summits. The format of joining both countriesâ top diplomats with their defense chiefs â thus â2+2â â emerged out of a recognition that decisions to meaningfully expand security ties required the sign-off of both departments. A summit was the forcing function designed to compel progress. This time, the most significant outcome was the completion of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), which, along with the previously signed Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, and the Industrial Security Annex to the General Security of Military Information Agreement, completes the â<a href=\"https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DRM-2016-U-013926-Final2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defense foundational agreements</a>â between the two countries.</p>"+
   "<p>Such an agreement was a long time in coming. It took some 15 years to get to this point if one starts counting when the second U.S.-India Defense Framework Agreement was signed in 2005, or possibly 25 years if one begins with first Defense Framework Agreement in 1995. As one Pentagon staffer recently commented, âWeâve had the SecDef [Secretary of Defense] ask the Indians to complete these agreements for so long that weâre going to be a loss when we need to draft the SecDef briefing book for his next India summit.â </p>"+
   "<p>The BECA, like the other foundational agreements, allows the U.S. military to partner with the Indian military in practical ways. This is, perhaps, why Indian officials objected to it for so long. BECA establishes procedures for India to obtain real-time access to U.S. information that will enhance the accuracy of automated systems and weapons, as well as improve navigation and reconnaissance. This includes geospatial intelligence such as geomagnetic data, gravity data, and aeronautical and nautical charts. But information flows both ways. For years, the Indian establishment feared that the pact would compromise the security of information about Indian military assets â and even allow the U.S. to share such information with Pakistan. Many Indians also believed that the agreement would compromise Indian military autonomy and independence. This was yet another legacy of Indiaâs Cold War ânon-alignedâ mentality.</p>"+
   "<p>When the Modi government came to power, it took a new look at these unsigned agreements. While some Indian military officials and diplomats who had worked closely with the Pentagon already appreciated the value of these agreements, the general senior leadership view previously appeared to be that signing these agreements was doing the U.S. a favor. Therefore, India would wait a year or so between signing each agreement in order to use them to extract concessions from the U.S. on issues that were of greater priority to New Delhi.</p>"+
   "<p>The timing of the completion of BECA and the other commitments made at the third 2+2 indicates that Delhiâs thinking may have changed. If Delhi had seen BECA as a means ingratiating itself with the U.S. government â rather than an agreement in Indiaâs own interests â the Modi government would have waited until next year, when a new administration might be in place. The fact that India signed this agreement now suggests there is a genuine desire to enhance military cooperation with the United States. </p>"+
   "<p>Outside observers and commentators understandably focus on geopolitical forces like China that are shaping the relationship between the United States and India, but it takes government officials to generate and implement tangible proposals for enhanced cooperation. U.S.-India bilateral meetings are evolving from events that produced mostly political statements to summits with outcomes that testify to concrete actions. This trend demonstrates that real cooperative mechanisms are being built, slowly but steadily, between the two countries. </p>"+
   "<p>The resulting change in the U.S.-India security relationship is broad. For many years, the U.S. has proposed Special Operations cooperation, a U.S.-India Defense Cyber Dialogue, the introduction of an Indian liaison officer at U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, and a follow-on summit on the Industrial Security Annex, which allows classified information sharing for private defense-industrial cooperation. All of these proposals were resisted by Indian governments â until now. It has taken a long time, but the threat of the Chinese military may have finally generated a critical mass of supporters in Delhi for a meaningful partnership with the U.S. military at the operational level.</p>"+

   intro: "Anyone who has watched popular films such as Zero Dark Thirty, 12 Strong, Lone Survivor, or Blackhawk Down can appreciate the dangers associated with these types of military operations. Given these hazards, one has to wonder: why are special operations ever conducted in the first place?",
   articleHTML: "<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/467730409\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"+
   "<p>The eminent and recently-deceased scholar of strategic theory and military history, Colin S. Gray, once described special operations as âhandfuls of heroes on desperate ventures.â Indeed, anyone who has watched popular films such as <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>, <em>12 Strong</em>, <em>Lone Survivor</em>, or <em>Blackhawk Down</em> can appreciate the dangers associated with these types of military operations. Given these hazards, one has to wonder: why are special operations ever conducted in the first place?</p>"+
   "<p>The answer lies in the consideration of risk. Because policy-makers inherently rely upon some form of popular support to maintain their positions of power, they are also inherently averse to taking risky actions. Thus, when considering solutions to various policy problems, they will seek and select options that present the lowest overall riskâboth the risk of failure in resolving the policy problem and the risk of negative blowback. </p>"+
   "<p>For problems that are inherently easy, policy-makers will generally be satisfied with options naturally produced by their bureaucracies, because these problems are of such a routine nature that the leader can be assured of successful resolution via orthodox (standard) means, and because standard (orthodox) solutions engender the lowest risk of blowback. The figure below shows various types of operations according to the nature of the policy problem (easy or difficult) and nature of the solution (orthodox or unorthodox). In it, I have labeled orthodox solutions to easy policy problems as âstandard operations.â</p>"+
   "<!--CHART HERE-->"+
   "<style>td {border: 1px solid black; padding:20px; height:150px; text-align:center;} th {padding: 20px; text-align:center;} .vertical { border:none;-webkit-transform: rotate(270deg); -moz-transform: rotate(270deg);-o-transform: rotate(270deg);}</style>"+
   "<table cellspacing=\"0\"><tfoot><tr><th colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border:none;\"></th><th>Orthodox</th><th>Unorthodox</th></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Nature of Solution</th></tr></tfoot>"+
   "<tbody><tr><th rowspan=\"2\"  class=\"vertical\">Nature of Policy Problem</th><th class=\"vertical\">Difficult</th><td>Elite Operations</td><td>Special Operations</td></tr><tr><th class=\"vertical\">Easy</th><td>Standard Operations</td><td>Experimental Operations</td></tr></tbody></table>"+
   "<p>Difficult policy problemsâfor example, those that are hard to fully understand or are particularly politically sensitiveâpose a different situation. In these cases, policy-makers will be more attuned to the risks of failure and blowback. The bureaucracies will still be inclined to produce orthodox (standard) solutions to those problems, but they will attempt to lower the risk of failure by offering to conduct those operations with elite individuals or units (in some cases also featuring elite equipment or technologies). For example, the 82nd Airborne Division is generally considered an âeliteâ division within the U.S. Army. For this reason, I have labeled orthodox solutions to difficult policy problems as âelite operations.â Policy-makers attempting to address difficult policy problems will tend to default to elite operations, because they offer a means of lowering the risk of failure while keeping the risk of bureaucratic blowback low (because the bureaucracy typically prefers orthodox solutions).</p>"+
   "<p>In some cases, however, even an elite orthodox solution to a difficult policy problem will be viewed by policy-makers as unacceptably risky. In these instances, leaders may choose inaction and either acceptance or mitigation of negative consequences likely to accrue from the policy problem. Or, they may be unwilling or unable to accept those consequences, and may instead ask for unorthodox options that are wholly different from those the bureaucracy might normally produceâthat is, ideas or methods that are different from what is usual or expected. Referring back to the figure, unorthodox solutions to a difficult policy problem are labeled as âspecial operations,â with the following definition: <em>Special operations are unorthodox military solutions to difficult policy problems that lower the level of risk to policy-makers.</em></p>"+
   "<p>One example was the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Ladenâs compound in Pakistan. While raids are a standard type of U.S. military operation, the fact that the SEALs conducted this particular one over a distance of 162 miles, at night, into a semi-permissible (and possibly denied) area made it an unorthodox solution to the difficult policy problem of trying to capture or kill bin Laden. Why did President Obama choose this option? Because he deemed the other options presented to himâdestruction of bin Ladenâs compound by B-2 stealth bombers, a surgical air strike from an experimental drone, or inactionâto be too risky relative to his desired policy outcomes.</p>"+
   "<p>This is why special operations are conducted: <em>if policy-makers have a difficult policy problem and they are unsatisfied with the level of risk presented by orthodox solutions or inaction, then they will choose special operations.</em></p>"+
   "<p>Policy-makers understand that special operations are risky. But, if special operationsâunorthodox solutionsâcan offer a lower overall risk profile than elite operations or inaction/mitigation, then policy-makers are likely to choose them.</p>"+
   "<p>This answer to the question of why special operations are conducted offers four implications for the future. First, policy-makers will always grapple with difficult policy problems. Inevitably, some of those problems will not be resolvable within policy-makersâ risk tolerances and they will seek unorthodox solutions. Thus, there will always be some demand for special operationsâfor the military, they are a natural feature of the strategic level of war.</p>"+
   "<p>Second, there is no guarantee that future special operations will be conducted solely by âspecial operations forcesâ (SOF). The existence of modern-day SOFâforces specially assessed and selected to institutionalize the generation of unorthodox solutionsâis a historical anomaly, as one can identify special military operations throughout history. Thus, the answer to why special operations are conducted not only suggests that special operations could be conducted by non-SOF entities, but also predicts that this will inevitably happen unless SOF can somehow monopolize the production of unorthodox solutions (which seems unlikely).</p>"+
   "<p>Third, at least within the U.S. military, there has been remarkable growth in the size, structure, resources, and responsibilities, as well as institutionalization, of its SOF over the past 20 years. There are two historical aspects of this institutionalization:</p>"+
   "<ul><li>The desire of U.S. policy-makers to decrease steadily the risk profile of U.S. activities overseas has led to a consistent trend of them asking SOF to solve their most difficult policy problems, but also increasingly to solve their easy ones, too. The net result of this situation is that U.S. SOF are increasingly being asked to undertake elite or, in some cases, standard operationsâsuch as training foreign militaries in peaceful countriesâas opposed to being used only for special operations.</li>"+
   "<li>This situation is compounded by the absence of bureaucratic blowback that might otherwise be expected from a policy-makerâs request for an unorthodox solution. In the U.S. military, SOF are no longer generally seen as secretive, squirrely, fringe elements that should be viewed with bureaucratic suspicion. The net result is that the bureaucracy (e.g., the military services) has mostly accepted both the growth of the special operations enterprise and the drift of SOF into elite and standard operations (indeed, in some instances, the services have deliberately pushed standard operations that they do not want to conduct over to SOF). This carries the risk of the U.S. special operations enterprise becoming less âspecialâ over time, since increased adoption and execution of elite and standard operations necessarily dilutes the focus of the enterprise on those aspects that make it unorthodox.</li></ul>"+
   "<p>Extending these trends reveals a fourth implicationâthat the future is likely to hold significant choices and tensions for leaders of U.S. SOF. Should they chart a course that errs on the side of remaining consistently unorthodox and incur bureaucratic risk (e.g., to resources and prestige) that might accompany a retrenchment of SOF to a narrower focus on special operations as defined above? Or should they give in to the entreaties of the conventional force for greater integration, interoperability, and interdependenceâand succumb to the pull of the orthodoxy?</p>"+
   "<p>This examination of the reason why special operations are conducted predicts that these tensions about the future trajectory of U.S. SOF will persist, as long as the force designed to be unorthodox remains institutionalized.</p>"+

   intro: "Prolonged pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, pose a particular dilemma as agencies decide when to conduct an after-action review.",
   articleHTML: "<p>Conducting after-action reviews of the response to incidents and emergencies is a common preparedness activity and a key component of the National Preparedness System. Agencies at all levels of government routinely assess their responses to all types of threats and hazards, including hurricanes, wildfires, transportation accidents, civil unrest, and mass shootings. These assessments typically occur soon after an incident is overâor has moved to the recovery phase. Prolonged pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, pose a particular dilemma as agencies decide when to conduct an after-action review.</p>"+
   "<p>The answer is now. Many public health and emergency management agencies are conducting interim reviews of the response to COVID-19 to gather lessons learned that can be incorporated into plans and help improve the response to later stages of the pandemic, when cases may resurge or when vaccination operations are underway. Interim reviews can also provide a baseline against which the response can be re-evaluated later, after improvements have been implemented.</p>"+
   "<p>Many agencies are also adopting processes of continuous improvement rather than relying on the traditional post-event after-action review. By conducting periodic assessmentsâe.g., on a weekly or monthly basisâagencies can identify challenges early and take action to address them before they become systematic problems. Data can be collected through open surveys, periodic hot wash meetings and interviews and monitoring performance metrics and then analyzed on a rolling basis, with findings presented to decision makers and operators for action.</p>"+
   "<p>It is difficult to devote resources to after-action reviews while in the middle of a high-paced pandemic response; however, by identifying and addressing challenges early agencies can continuously learn from and improve their operations.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on the world, Beijing is actively trying to shape how people remember the pandemic and Chinaâs role in it. The Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) is engaging in a propaganda campaign aimed at promoting narratives favorable to China and suppressing any that would tarnish its international image. At the heart of this campaign is the argument that China rose to the challenge of the outbreak and exemplified the role of a responsible great power. This core narrative seeks to erase the Chinese governmentâs missteps from the public memory so that only Chinaâs successes remain.</p>"+
   "<p>Domestically, the Chinese government is deeply invested in convincing the countryâs 1.4 billion people that it is capable of steering the nation through any and all challenges. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus at the end of 2019 posed the most serious threat to the Chinese Communist Partyâs  (CCP)âs legitimacy in decades, as citizens started to question whether their leaders were capable of dealing with the crisis.</p>"+
   "<p>As it became increasingly clear that Chinese government officials had gravely mishandled the initial situation, the PRC tried to suppress the truth, arresting journalists who reported on the actual extent of the outbreak in Wuhan and censoring online discussion to prevent the public from discussing its grievances. In place of alarming statistics and unvarnished accounts of human suffering, Chinaâs massive state-controlled media apparatus filled the airwaves with doctored data and pro-party kitsch. Beijing even tried to recast Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who was silenced by police after warning colleagues of the virus and who subsequently died of the illness in February, as a loyal CCP member, instead of the whistleblower that millions within China mourned him as.</p>"+
   "<p>COVID-19 has also threatened to shatter Beijingâs carefully cultivated image of the PRC as a responsible and open member of the international community. Chinaâs leaders are determined to convince the world that the PRC deserves its increasingly central role on the world stage, and so it is no surprise that Beijing has strived to avoid the stigma of being responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to spread beyond its borders. As early as January, the Chinese government has pushed back against calls by foreign observers to investigate the origin of the virus, claiming that such efforts are politically motivated attempts to smear China. In its efforts to avoid blame, Beijing has engaged in an unprecedented disinformation campaign aimed at sowing doubt that the virus first emerged in China, even going so far as suggesting that the U.S. Army could have initially brought the virus to Wuhan in the fall of 2019 when it participated in the World Military Games hosted there.</p>"+
   "<p>Beijing has attempted to position itself as a leader in the global struggle against the virus. It has used highly publicized foreign aid efforts, with the PRC Foreign Ministry declaring in mid-November that China had provided medical assistance to over 150 countries and international organizations in the fight against COVID-19. Beijing has also attempted to cast itself as a champion of multilateralism: throughout the pandemic, it has publicly praised the World Health Organization (WHO) and defended it in the face of U.S. criticism, despite having kept vital information about the virus from the United Nations body and preventing it from conducting a serious investigation into the source of the outbreak.</p>"+
   "<p>How people around the world perceive of Chinaâs handling of COVID-19 has major implications for broader issues of influence within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. In many ways, the pandemic has exacerbated bilateral tensions between the U.S. and China. Since March, when U.S. cases overtook those in China, Beijing has highlighted Washingtonâs struggle to contain the virus within the U.S. as a foil against which to highlight its own successes. For example, in contrast to its portrayal of the Peopleâs Liberation Army as having emerged stronger from its encounter with COVID-19, the Chinese press has shone a glaring spotlight on the virusâs effect on the U.S. military, with some media commentary asserting that U.S. military readiness has been compromised. Beijing has also argued that the PRCâs authoritarian model of governance is better equipped than US-style democracy to handle a major crisis.</p>"+
   "<p>Regardless of how the global pandemic develops in the future, the events of 2020 will live long in the public memory. The long-term effects of the crisis on Chinaâs international image, and whether the CCPâs handling of the crisis solidified its legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people or degraded the publicâs trust in the government, remain to be seen.</p>"+

However, emergency decisions often must be made with incomplete or conflicting information and under extreme time pressure and stressâconditions that can inhibit effective decision-making.

   articleHTML: "<p>Exercises play a vital role in preparing agencies to mitigate, respond to, and recover from all types of threats and hazards. These include infectious disease outbreaks, hurricanes, earthquakes and cyberattacks. Federal, state, local, tribal and territorial agencies routinely conduct exercises to provide a safe, low-risk environment for their personnel and community stakeholders to assess and validate existing disaster response plans, policies and procedures, or, in some instances, to develop plans, policies and procedures in response to new threats or hazards. Well-designed exercises enable participants to identify and address capability gaps and other areas for improvement before real-world disasters strike.</p>"+
   "<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, agencies continue to rely on their exercise programs to prepare for and respond to the ever-evolving challenges of COVID-19 while also maintaining their preparedness for other threats and hazards. However, conducting exercises during the COVID-19 pandemic has proven challenging. Many jurisdictions have had to restrict the size of gatherings to lower the risk of disease spread, thereby limiting the number of people that can attend exercises in person. Furthermore, personnel who would normally participate in exercises are often busy supporting pandemic response operations, particularly within emergency management and public health agencies. At the state and local levels, agencies are also experiencing budget cuts, resulting in lower funding levels for exercise programs. </p>" + 
   "<p>Faced with these constraints, agencies have had to think creatively about how to maximize the reach and benefit of their exercises. Many agencies are conducting fewer operations-based exercises, which include real-time mobilization of personnel and resources, in favor of more discussion-based exercises focused on strategic- and policy-oriented issues. A key benefit of discussion-based exercises is that they can be conducted virtually, enabling some or all of the participants to participate from the safety of dispersed worksites.</p>"+
   "<p>Given the demanding, time-consuming nature of COVID-19 response operations, agencies are also opting to shorten the duration of their exercises. Rather than designing full-day or half-day exercises, agencies are designing two- to three-hour-long exercises focused on a limited number of specific topics. Shorter, targeted exercises mean that agencies can more quickly develop after-action reports and identify corrective actions to address any identified gaps or challenges. The sooner agencies identify corrective actions, the sooner they can begin taking steps to implement those actions. </p>"+
   "<p>By opting for shorter, virtual, discussion-based exercises, many agencies have been able to sustain their exercise programs and maintain their preparedness for other potential threats and hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic. This new format is cost effective and offers flexibility that may continue to appeal to exercise planners and participants after the pandemic. </p>"+

   "<p>January 17, 2021, marks the 30th Anniversary of the beginning of operations to end Iraqâs invasion of Kuwait. In the three intervening decades, the landscape of adversaries and competitors facing U.S. forces has evolved markedly. But many operational realities that U.S. forces faced then remain relevant today. Iâd like to highlight three takeaways from Desert Storm that can still inform defense planning in the era of great power competition. </p>"+
   "<p>The first is that any crisis will require an immediate focus on creating large-scale teaming between the Navy and Marine Corps. Current plans call for such coordination, but Desert Storm showed that integration doesnât happen overnight.</p>"+
   "<p>Teaming was most obviously needed when planners were devising an amphibious assault on the shores of Kuwait. Such a dangerous operation would need a high degree of cooperation and trust between the Navy and Marine Corps, a common and deep understanding of the environment each was facing. But I did not see the sort of tight relationship that would have helped in planning, even as 11 amphibious assault plans were developed. Instead, I observed how relatively little the Marines in the command element knew about Navy operations. For example, planners even at a high level realized relatively late that the Navy would need 18 days to clear mines in advance of any assault. They didnât have the full picture that a close relationship with Navy planners might have provided. </p>"+
   "<p>In-depth, private, face-to-face talks between Marine Corps and Navy commanders â General Walter Boomer and his counterpart, Admiral Stanley Arthur â were attempted during Desert Storm. But achieving those talks when each commander has a significant number of distractions proved difficult. For example, in early February 1991, theater commanders in chief were to meet on USS <em>Blue Ridge</em> to make a final decision on an amphibious landing. Gen. Boomer meant to arrive well ahead of that meeting so that he and Adm. Arthur could consult privately to present a unified front. But bad weather prevented his early arrival. That private meeting never took place. The Navy-Marine Corps relationship needs a level of consistency to make it less vulnerable to the inevitable last-minute snafus like bad weather.</p>"+
   "<p>The intervening 30 years have not helped this problem, mostly because the Marine Corps has been focused on land warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will be hard to change the go-it-alone mindset that threatens full cooperation and understanding at the operational and tactical level. If naval forces are going to be successful in a great power competition environment, they need an intense focus on combined operations at the operational and tactical levels.</p>"+
   "<p>The second takeaway is that operational deception works. Those 11 amphibious assault plans were never put into action. The risk-to-reward ratio was considered too high. And yet, the threat of a landing played a key role in Desert Stormâs success. Marines practiced landings on small islands in the Persian Gulf, and their deceptive preparations for an amphibious assault continued after the decision was made against carrying it out. So Iraq kept some of its forces tied up along the coast to defend against a landing that was never coming. Meanwhile, on February 24, allied ground forces rolled across the land border with Saudi Arabia.</p>"+
   "<p>Then there was Task Force Troy, a fake division made up of little more than 100 Marine reservists. While the real Marine invasion force of the 2nd Marine Division moved west to approach Kuwait from a less direct angle, Task Force Troy kept up the illusion of an impending invasion straight up the middle. They had dummy tanks and artillery in sand berms, loudspeakers playing tank noises, and supply helicopters arriving to deliver absolutely nothing. Marines made aborted raids from the position days before the actual invasion. It worked. Captured Iraqi officers confirmed that they expected the Marines to cross from Task Force Troyâs position. </p>"+
   "<p>Deception is still an incredibly handy tool and shouldnât be discounted in great power competition. Our advanced competitors do have much better visibility today, but sowing doubt in the adversaryâs mind is still achievable and highly effective. Operational planners â and CNA analysts â are currently exploring such operations. Such ideas should continue to be pursued vigorously.</p>"+
   "<p>The third takeaway is that logistics in war is always important and more difficult than anticipated. The importance of logistics is a lesson re-learned in every war. I saw first-hand in Desert Storm just how fragile the whole system was. Ironically, I Marine Expeditionary Force had just participated in an exercise called Internal Look that was modeled on Iraq as the adversary. But it didnât test logistics realistically enough. The very same issues that would come up again in Desert Shield and Desert Storm were âfairy dustedâ away in the exercise.</p>"+
   "<p>In the real conflict with Iraq, Marines were operating way beyond the 300 mile range for expeditionary forces foreseen in Marine Corps doctrine. Joint logistics support was not reaching us. The Marines had to devise a whole new command structure to support operations. They also created a long-haul trucking company to make the logistics effort work. Then they had to scramble when operational plans shifted from one breach of border defenses to two.</p>"+
   "<p>In the end, we were very lucky with logistics in Desert Storm. We had near misses and good fortune. Iraqi forces largely held back, giving the allies six months to iron out kinks in the system. A forward logistics site was moved just hours before a FROG missile hit the abandoned site.</p>"+
   "<p>The challenges of logistics in this era of great power competition are similar â but even more demanding. Just as in Desert Storm, logistics need to be agile, survivable and robust. Details have to be worked out; forethought needs to be given. Nothing can be assumed away. The imperative for the armed forces â and for operations analysts at CNA â is to constantly push the âwhat if?â and imagine logistics challenges that are being ignored. One place to start is by looking back at the challenges of past operations, even those that took place 30 years ago. </p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>Last week, President-elect Biden announced plans to release nearly all available COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. when he takes office in an effort to speed up delivery of the vaccine to Americans. The Trump administration had purposely held back doses of the vaccine to ensure availability of the required second dose, though recently changed its position as well in favor of releasing more vaccine doses. However, with fewer than 12 million Americans having received the COVID-19 vaccine to date, there is intense pressure on government officials to vaccinate the public faster. But does Bidenâs proposal actually address the root cause of the problems plaguing the vaccine rollout?</p>"+
   "<p>The path from vaccine manufacturing, to distribution to states and local jurisdictions, to dispensing to the public is littered with logistical hurdles. In our conversations with state and local health officials, a primary concern was the lack of having qualified and trained personnel to safely administer the vaccine. In theory, pushing out existing vaccine reserves to states and localities may seem like a logical way to get more people vaccinated faster, but that requires having sufficient demand and capacity in place on the receiving end. In reality, many states are struggling to dispense the vaccine doses theyâve received for a variety of reasons, such as restrictions on eligibility criteria, trouble with vaccine registration systems, lack of funding and resources, and, in some cases, lagging demand among health care workers. Itâs hard to see how increasing vaccine flow to states and localities will help without having a better understanding of the myriad challenges at the point of administration. Also, depending on manufacturing capacity, the new strategy could delay when people can get their second dose if sufficient quantities are not available in time. Delaying the second dose (or altering the dose given, as has also been discussed) poses an inherent risk: we have no concrete basis for understanding how this might affect the recipientâs ability to build and maintain an effective immune response. And then thereâs the massive public messaging effort that will be needed to clearly communicate why this change is happening and how it will affect the established priority tiers, and to educate people who are already skeptical or reluctant to get the vaccine.</p>"+
   "<p>Rather than approach this simply as a supply problem, the new administration should focus on identifying the factors most responsible for delaying vaccine administration so it can tailor interventions accordingly. The last thing a weary public needs is more confusion brought about by a strategy change that merely trades one set of challenges for another. </p>"+

   intro: "Over the past few years, great power competition (GPC) has become the organizing principle for US national strategy. ",
   articleHTML: "<p>Over the past few years, great power competition (GPC) has become the organizing principle for US national strategy. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) codified growing discussion that the United States is in a &quot;great power competition&quot; with both China and Russia. Since then, US policymakers and strategists have relied on GPC to orient national strategy. This concept also is the organizing principle behind the summary of the 2018 <a href='https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf'>National Defense Strategy</a> (NDS) and the Joint Staff&rsquo;s overview of the <a href='https://www.jcs.mil/Media/News/News-Display/Article/1903669/description-of-the-2018-national-military-strategy-released/'>National Military Strategy</a> released in 2019.</p><p>As a new administration enters office, there have been discussions about whether the GPC concept may be altered, or even <a href='https://defense360.csis.org/bad-idea-great-power-competition-terminology/'>jettisoned altogether</a>. Questions also have emerged about the degree to which the US should be focused on China over Russia. Moreover, GPC focuses on great or major powers rather than <a href='https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Quad%20Plus%20Special%20Issue.pdf'>small states</a>, which constitute the majority of the international system and frequently raise questions among observers about their potential alignment with competitors. So what issues should the new administration prioritize?</p><p>First, regardless of the particular phrase the Biden administration decides to use, US strategic competition with China and Russia will likely continue for the foreseeable future. Over the past decade, an increasingly tense dynamic has come to define the US-China relationship across a number of dimensions. While China&rsquo;s rise often eclipses the threat from Russia, the recent hacking of US government systems reminds observers that Russia&rsquo;s competitive activities, even when asymmetric, have wide-ranging effects.</p><p>Second, US policymakers should reframe GPC to focus beyond the adversarial dimension of international relations. That Russia and China <em>compete</em> with the US is self-evident. At the national defense level, the US has focused on increased the lethality of the military services and acknowledged its reliance on alliances and strategic partnerships. Yet, this focus on competition has, to some extent, <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/DCP-2020-U-027193-Final%20(002).pdf'>obscured</a> how <em>competitors also cooperate</em> while <em>allies compete</em> with each other.</p><p>Given this reality, Washington should devote more attention to the interconnected, cooperative nature of international politics and economics and the implications for US national strategy. Some strategists, such as <a href='https://www.nbr.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/publications/sa20_overview_tellis_dec2019advance.pdf'>Ashley Tellis</a>, acknowledge the degree of economic interdependence between the US and China and observe that a meaningful effort to reduce China&rsquo;s growth &quot;would require the United States to suffer losses in its own prosperity and welfare.&quot; Meanwhile, the US and China have converging interests in some regions, such as secure <a href='https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/IndoPacificPerspectives/Samaranayake.html'>Indian Ocean sea lanes and commerce</a>. In addition to <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/CRM-2020-U-027973-Final%20(002).pdf'>managing the escalation</a> of competition with Russia, the US will need to cooperate with Moscow on issues such as nuclear arms control, especially given the imminent expiration date for <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/IRM-2019-U-019494.pdf'>the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) agreement</a>. Governance of the melting <a href='http://cimsec.org/a-new-arctic-strategy-for-an-emerging-maritime-domain/47233'>Arctic region</a> is another example where the US would benefit from cooperating with Russia, especially as concern mounts over <a href='https://www.lawfareblog.com/arctic-provisions-2020-ndaa'>China&rsquo;s financial activities</a> there.</p><p>Conversely, the aforementioned US national security and defense strategies rightly emphasize the importance of alliances and partnerships with non-allied countries. The NSS, for example, prioritizes building quadrilateral cooperation with Japan, Australia and India through what is known as the Quad. Indeed, the Quad grew significantly over the past four years, resulting in dialogue at the secretary of state level and the MALABAR exercise in 2020, with participation by all four navies. Meanwhile, the NDS highlights the need to strengthen alliances and partnerships as the second of its three lines of effort.</p><p>Still, even allies compete with the US. In 2015&ndash;2019, for example, France became the <a href='https://rusi.org/commentary/constants-and-changes-france-arms-export-strategy'>third-largest exporter of weapons</a> in the world and is a <a href='https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/usa-and-france-dramatically-increase-major-arms-exports-saudi-arabia-largest-arms-importer-says'>competitor to the US</a> in this arena. This includes French defense sales to India, which the US designated as a <a href='https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1704150/us-india-strengthen-defense-cooperation/#:~:text=India%20has%20major%20defense%20partner,such%20as%20the%20NATO%20nations.'>major defense partner</a> and has been a focal point of US strategy in Asia for the past 20 years, long before the Indo-Pacific strategy. Other allies, such as <a href='https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/'>Germany and the United Kingdom</a>, also compete with the US in arms exports.</p><p>The GPC concept has been refined since its initial formulation in the NSS. For example, the December 2018 <a href='https://news.usni.org/2018/12/17/design-maintaining-maritime-superiority-2-0'><em>A Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority 2.0</em></a> discussed the <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5633091-A-Design-for-Maintaining-Maritime-Superiority.html'>&quot;competition-conflict spectrum&quot;</a> and depicted the concept using a linear visualization. Then, in 2019, the Joint Chiefs of Staff released Joint Doctrine Note (JDN) 1-19: Competition Continuum, which adds the concept of cooperation alongside the ideas of competition below armed conflict and armed conflict. The document observes that &quot;just as competitors can cooperate, friendly states can compete.&quot; My CNA colleagues have provided a <a href='/CNA_files/PDF/DIM-2019-U-021755-1Rev.pdf'>helpful visualization of the Competition Continuum</a> to highlight JDN 1-19&rsquo;s contribution to the discourse.</p><p>The incoming Biden administration should revamp the GPC concept by building on this important insight. Assessing the individual and combined threats from China and Russia will continue to be vital to US interests, but considering potential opportunities to cooperate with competitors will also be critical. Washington should also evaluate the range of competition with allies across multiple dimensions and consider how to minimize competition where possible, especially with an eye toward the pursuit of shared interests in the context of GPC. With GPC seemingly here to stay, US national strategy will need to be continually refined along conceptual and operational lines. The start of the Biden presidency is a moment to build on the progress made in the past few years and consider how policymakers can develop and implement strategy with greater nuance in the coming decade.</p><hr /><p><em>Nilanthi Samaranayake directs the&nbsp;</em><a href='/centers/cna/sppp/spa/'><em>Strategy and Policy Analysis</em></a><em>&nbsp;program and focuses on the study of US alliances and strategic partnerships globally.

   intro: "Just over 24 hours into the new Biden administration, the Washington Post broke the news that the newly sworn in President plans to accept Russiaâs proposal to extend the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (or New START) for an additional five years. ",
   articleHTML: "<p>Just over 24 hours into the new Biden administration, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-russia-nuclear-treaty-extension/2021/01/21/4667a11e-5b40-11eb-aaad-93988621dd28_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a> broke the news that the newly sworn in President plans to accept Russiaâs proposal to extend the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for an additional five years. Though New START alone is not sufficient for a world of new weapons and rising nuclear powers, the decision to extend New START was a critical and prudent choice. The existing treaty is an essential springboard to figuring out what should come next in strategic arms control. Its extension buys the new administration a precious strategic asset: time. </p>"+
   "<p>Accepting the extension is a departure from the previous administrationâs threats to allow New START to expire on February 5, 2021. The threat was a bargaining tactic in an attempt to secure a new nuclear arms control treaty with both Russia and China and, later, to limit Russiaâs overall nuclear stockpile. Though the Trump administrationâs approach bore no fruit, the sightline of these efforts was looking in the right direction by considering new arms control constructs that depart from bilateral reductions and a narrow focus on intercontinental-range delivery vehicles and deployed warheads. </p>"+
   "<p>New START is currently the only strategic arms control treaty remaining in the U.S.-Russia relationship, following the United Statesâ withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in August 2019 after repeated non-compliance by Russia. New START features a cap of 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads for both Washington and Moscow and a robust verification and monitoring regime. </p>"+
   "<p>But New START is increasingly becoming a security stopgap. <a href=\"/CNA_files/PDF/IRM-2019-U-019494.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Previous CNA analysis</a> concluded that the threat perceptions of the two countries are diverging, especially from the Russian point of view. New START constrains U.S. intercontinental-range nuclear systems, but it does not account for non-nuclear capabilities, such as missile defense and hypersonic boost-glide vehicles that pose concerns for Russia about the survivability of their nuclear deterrent.</p>"+
   "<p>From the U.S. point of view, Russiaâs pursuit of various âexoticâ dual-capable weapons that can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads and Russiaâs non-compliance with the INF Treaty have intensified U.S. interest in greater transparency and limitations that include non-strategic or theater-range systems that could hold U.S. forward-deployed forces and regional allies at risk. In a world without New START and with increasing competition, such challenges and uncertainties likely would have led to precautionary solutions by both sides, such as increasing nuclear force levels and undoing the previous 11 years of reductions and limitations.</p><p>The extension of New START canât halt these negative trends, but it is a step in the right direction to prevent them from becoming more severe.</p>"+
   "<p>The New START extension has also prepared a critical glide path to new solutions for 21st-century nuclear risks. This was emphasized by the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2479274/statement-by-john-kirby-chief-pentagon-spokesman-on-new-start/source/GovDelivery/\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Department</a>, which released a statement touting that the extension âallows time and space for our two nations to explore new verifiable arms control arrangements that could further reduce risks to Americans.â The Biden administration should seize this opportunity to make headway on finding these potential solutions by pursuing the following recommendations we outlined in 2019.</p>"+
   "<p>First, the new Biden administration should seek a renewed and reinvigorated strategic dialogue with Moscow alongside formal negotiations. Such a dual-track construct was originally pursued by the Obama administration and a similar approach was adopted by the Trump administration, as treaty negotiations are often not able to accommodate a full discussion of all concerns held by both parties. </p>"+
   "<p>It is important to note that pursuing a new strategic dialogue does not require a âresetâ of relations. Unresolved security concerns the United States has with Russian interference in its electoral process and the SolarWinds cyberattack have not created the environment for a reset. Critics of a new strategic dialogue with Russia generally argue that it acts as a ârewardâ for Russia. This dangerously ignores the reality that the threat of nuclear exchange increases with competition. A lack of dialogue will only serve to keep this status quo â if not throw more fuel on the fire.</p>"+
   "<p>The new administration will need a more holistic approach than either of its predecessors used, one that accounts for concerns surrounding both capabilities and intent. This will require an interagency delegation that fosters intellectual engagement from mid- and senior-level officials as well as their staff on issues they may not have in their day-to-day portfolios. By breaking down stovepipes across nuclear weapons, conventional forces, space, and cyber operations and by involving knowledgeable experts even up to senior levels, the Biden administration can simultaneously raise the stakes of these dialogues while also ensuring these festering concerns donât remain unaddressed.</p>"+
   "<p>Second, this strategic dialogue construct needs a clear vision to enhance transparency and strategic predictability between the two countries. The first objective should be to address potential misperceptions. Such an objective is two-fold in its requirements: first there should be an effort to explain U.S. thinking on what it sees as misperceptions by Russia that are a danger to the security of the United States and its allies, second is an effort by the U.S. to gain a better understanding of Russian strategy and intent. </p>"+
   "<p>The next objective should be to begin discussions about the various weapons systems that both sides view as a threat due to their potential to undermine its secure second-strike capabilities. However this discussion should not be an unstructured one, in which all topics are on the table. This objective would be best served by cooperative planning and deliberate agenda setting at the expert level that is determined beforehand to ensure that such a dialogue doesnât ring hollow.</p>"+
   "<p>By pursuing a broader dialogue that seeks to improve understanding and transparency of force structures and strategic thinking, the U.S. can build upon the New START extension. An opportunity awaits to avoid an opaque relationship in which flawed assessments of each otherâs capabilities, strategy and intent risk arms competition or even potential nuclear escalation. A renewed dialogue with a clear vision of objectives, mid- to senior-level engagement, and a delegation with cross-cutting knowledge of the strategic landscape is a first step toward realizing this important goal. </p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>The U.S. Navy achieved a lot of successes in Desert Storm. But I am a big believer that we should never miss an opportunity to relook at every decision and performance metric of man and machine so that we can do better the next time. In order to learn those lessons, I discovered early on in my career that it helps to use the right metrics and the right analytical partner. </p>"+
   "<p>I discovered the value of an analytical partnership as a young officer. I was ordered to VX-1, a squadron dedicated to evaluating various weapons and systems for antisubmarine warfare. My first assignment as a project officer was to determine the suitability of the AS-12, a French, wire-guided missile to be used by patrol aircraft against Soviet Komar-class boats. The first part of the process was to develop a test plan that would determine its effectiveness to counter the threat. This was to be an expedited study, with a limited number of live-fire missiles provided. </p>"+
   "<p>In VX-1 we had an assigned CNA Operations Evaluation Group (OEG) field representative who had to endorse each test plan to ensure that it provided a solid basis for any conclusions and recommendations. When I explained that we were going calculate the AS-12âs effectiveness with our limited number of missiles, he told me what I didnât want to hear: There would be no possibility of providing a valid probability of hit and kill with such a small number of data points. But after encouraging me to adjust my sights on a more realistic performance metric, he was most helpful in developing a test plan. </p>"+
   "<p>Preparing for that test, I learned another potent lesson about using the right metric. My team went to France for factory training on how to properly handle and use the missile. We spent hours in the simulator room, where a projector could provide a sequence of launch and a tracking light with which to guide the missile. The four or five of us being trained were carefully observed, and the result of each simulated missile launch was recorded, resulting in a median miss distance, commonly called âcircular error probable,â or CEP. In the back of the room was an extra observer, who I assumed was there to keep an eye on our instructor.</p>"+
   "<p>At the end of our week of training, the factory instructor pulled me aside and explained the purpose of the other observer. Despite whatever CEP score each of our shooters achieved on the simulator, the observer could predict with great certainty who could hit with the real thing. Over years of using the missile, the French had determined that certain operators could be aces on the simulator, with small miss distances, and still be a bust when trying to guide the real thing. It was critical to understand that results from simulations, tests and actual operations were not necessarily the same. For this missile and this target, a close miss had little chance of resulting in a kill. The important metric was the probability of hit, not CEP; the French trained to probability of hit. </p>"+
   "<p>Our live-fire tests proved that the hit metric was indeed best for this missile-target combination. With the right metric and the OEG field rep overseeing the test plan, our evaluation provided the best possible clue as to whether the system would be a viable option to counter the threat.</p>"+
   "<p>So well before Desert Storm, I had learned two important lessons that I continued to apply as I rose through the ranks: Get the OEG field representative into the picture as soon as possible, and with any guided weapon, know which is more important â the CEP or probability of hit. The warhead and target will dictate.</p>"+
   "<p>Knowing those two things created a valuable opportunity for the Navy to learn from our experience in Desert Storm employing the Tomahawk missile. About a month before the war began, I had to sell skeptical leadership on a plan to give the Navyâs cruise missile a role in the critical first night of Desert Storm. The Tomahawk had never been used in combat before. With Generals Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell around the table, I displayed a diagram of a baseball field. I explained that years of operational test firings showed that the Tomahawk would not land somewhere in the outfield or even on a random spot inside the bases. It would hit the pitcherâs mound. </p>"+
   "<p>The argument was sufficiently convincing, and the Navy launched 118 Tomahawks in the first 24 hours of Desert Storm. We quickly learned that we needed to review how we staged the entry of multiple launches into the same target area. Sending four missiles down the same street hands the adversary an opportunity to shoot down the last in line. </p>"+
   "<p>But the enduring insight I carried with me about targeting metrics convinced me that there were more important lessons to be learned, and I knew the right partner to pursue those lessons. I thought there could be a way to reconstruct each missileâs prescribed track and determine if it reached its intended target. This would require access to very sensitive observations of the target area and route of flight. I asked my embarked CNA representative to inquire whether CNA would be interested in doing such a study. We received lots of pushback from the Tomahawk program office and from intelligence agencies that would have some of the information needed. Christine Fox and her team at CNA did a marvelous job of making this happen. In the end, we learned that even with a launch-and-forget system, there are many places in the planning cycle and delivery instructions where improvements had to be made. Desert Storm showed that we were doing a lot of things right. More importantly, it showed how we could do even better.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>Desert Storm ushered in what would be called âthe new American way of war.â Precision-guided munitions, combined with reconnaissance and battle networks, were pivotal technological developments that contributed to Desert Stormâs sweeping success. Ironically, these weapons and systems were developed for an adversary and battlefield nothing like the one faced in the Persian Gulf 30 years ago. The history of their development and their successful â and sometimes unsuccessful â use should inform the development of the next generation of defense systems. </p>"+
   "<p>In the 1991 Gulf War, precision systems â and a well-led, well-trained force using them â made for a conflict unlike any before it in history. This was largely an air war: The first 90% of the operation was the shaping and destruction of targets including air defense, Iraqi forces and facilities, and strategic targets. With the availability of precision weapons, smaller but valuable targets were feasible objectives compared to what was achievable with unguided, âdumbâ bombs. The U.S. Air Force F-117A stealth Nighthawk played a key role in the air campaign. The existence of the secret attack aircraft had only been acknowledged three years before. It struck 40% of the targets hit within the first three days. These strikes were critical in degrading air defense and communications networks, allowing greater freedom of action for the rest of the campaign. Laser-guided bombs also proved highly effective. CNA analysis calculated a 60% hit rate for these precision weapons against bridges. In contrast, fewer than 1 in 14 unguided bombs hit bridge targets.</p>"+
   "<p>Importantly, the new way of war contributed to unusually low casualties for both coalition troops and civilians compared to other 20th century wars. Certainly Saddam Husseinâs unmotivated forces and other unusual conditions helped, but success from the air also greatly reduced the riskier role of ground troops. The month-long air war was followed by a lightning-fast, 100-hour ground war. Precision munitions also reduced the number of bombs that were needed; previously many munitions would be dropped in order to have a high confidence that a target would be struck. This helped keep civilian casualties to fraction of those seen in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, when U.S. bombardments depended heavily on area weapons.</p>"+
   "<p>This is what military planners call an âoffset strategy.â Offsets address what appears to be a competition that is unwinnable â or winnable only at unacceptable cost â by changing the balance through the application of different strengths. Since World War II, the U.S. has announced three such offset strategies. The First Offset, near the tail end of the Korean War, related to nuclear deterrence. </p>"+
   "<p>The Second Offset proposed advanced technology to provide better information on the battlefield and develop the ability to conduct precision strikes in order to improve combat effectiveness. This involved the development of new precision weapons â both laser-guided and GPS-guided munitions â combined with new surveillance capabilities and new battle networks for exchanging targeting information quickly to forces that needed it. This Second Offset effort was remarkable for its singular and sustained focus. It was not a general call for a broad application of technology. Specific enabling capabilities for particular operational requirements were pursued and developed consistently over the course of two decades to help deter a Soviet invasion. </p>"+
   "<p>Thankfully, these weapons were never used against their intended target; that is exactly the point of a deterrent. In Desert Storm, and later in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, the Second Offset systems proved themselves ideally suited to targeting traditional military objectives. That does not mean they have been a panacea for every military requirement. U.S. forces relied on similar precision airpower to try to drive ISIS from the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017. By the time ISIS had been defeated, âprecisionâ weaponry had rendered 80 percent of the city uninhabitable and killed many civilians. Clearly, the weapons systems design to combat the Soviet army on the plains of Central Europe were not ideally suited against non-state armed groups in an urban environment. </p>"+
   "<p>What can these successes and failures of the Second Offset teach us as the Department of Defense tries to implement the Third Offset? This strategic turn began in 2014. Acknowledging that great power competitors had caught up in much Second Offset technology and had other advantages of size and geography, the Third Offset seeks to broadly pursue artificial intelligence and autonomy, to leverage them for military advantage.</p>"+
   "<p>The first lesson is that Second Offset weapons development succeeded precisely because it was not a broad pursuit of technology. The Third Offset would benefit from a similar effort to maintain a sustained, patient focus on a limited number of operational imperatives and enabling technologies within the vast fields of AI and autonomy.  </p>"+
   "<p>A second lesson: history has taught us that however vital it may be to prepare for the most formidable threat, U.S. forces are more likely to end up engaging with lower-end threats. And the U.S. has repeatedly found itself lacking some of the capabilities needed for that set of threats. As the nation progresses in Third Offset technology, itâs not too soon to begin analyzing how these capabilities might â and might not â be adapted to the adversaries we are more likely to face. Thirty years ago, success in Desert Storm was partially an unintended consequence of preparing for âthe big one.â As a military strategy, it would be better to plan for intended consequences. </p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p><em>The following is an excerpt from an article that appeared just a few months after the end of Desert Storm, in Proceedings, the magazine of the U.S. Naval Institute. The full text of the <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1991/may/storm-sea\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> is available to USNI members in the Proceedings archive.</em></p>"+
   "<p>In the early morning hours of 17 January, Operation Desert Storm was executed with the commencement of the air campaign. It is well known by now that Desert Storm was planned as a four-phase evolution. The strategic air campaign found all six carriers fully integrated into the structure, together with our Tomahawk cruise missile launch platforms. The choreography of this portion of the campaign was exceptionally well done, and much credit must go to Air Force Lieutenant General Charles Horner, Joint Force Air Component Commander, and his air campaign planners. Using every type of theater-based asset and some from out-of-theater, this precisely timed event placed as many as 1,000 sorties per day on very discrete and carefully planned targets.</p>"+
   "<p>Command-and-control and communications facilities, headquarters, power-distribution centers, and early warning radars were primary targets. Our having enough forces to hit this wide range of targets â nearly simultaneously â had a devastating effect on Iraqâs ability to actively engage follow-on strikes with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) or ground- controlled interceptors. Iraqâs inability to pose a significant threat permitted aircrews to optimize their delivery tactics, to avoid the considerable antiaircraft artillery threat and to reduce the number of combat air patrol (CAP) aircraft required over the target area.</p>"+
   "<p>With many of these early flights going to the vicinity of Baghdad, Navy strike aircraft were flying long missions. If one superimposes Baghdad on Detroit, the Red Sea strikes were launching from Little Rock, Arkansas, and the Arabian Gulf strikes from Richmond Virginia â long round-trip flights by any measure. The Red Sea crews were getting five-hour flights with pre- and post-target tanking. That takes a lot of physical and mental stamina.</p>"+
   "<p>We launched Tomahawk missiles from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. This âreach out and touch someoneâ weapon proved to be a real plus. During periods of bad weather when you needed to keep the pressure on Baghdad, you could continue to keep their eyes (as well as the cameras of CNN) open. The pinpoint accuracy and resultant low risk of collateral damage were what kept this system in the air when others were diverted to secondary targets. The guided-missile cruiser USS San Jacinto (CG- 56) holds the record for launching the first Tomahawk; the destroyer USS Fife (DD-991) was the most prolific shooter; and the USS Louisville (SSN-724) became the first U.S. submarine since World War II to strike in anger. With nearly 300 Tomahawks launched, there is a wealth of data to point us in the right direction for upgrades and/or a follow-on system. The first operational deployment of this system should validate the careful manner in which this program was brought into the fleet. By every measure, this system performed superbly.</p>"+
   "<p>While the world through the eyes of CNN was riveted on the air campaign, the Storm-at-Sea was off and running. After reports by strike aircraft of receiving fire from oil platforms, the guided-missile frigate USS Nicholas (FFG-47) with her embarked Army OH-58D (AHIP, Army Helicopter Improvement Program) helos along with a Kuwaiti Navy patrol boat cleared the platforms and captured the first enemy prisoners. (See âTaking Down the Oil Platforms,â page 53, April 1991 Proceedings.) It was learned later that this action caused the Iraqis to begin vacating the remaining platforms and offshore islands. A few days later, a suspected minelayer was caught near Qaruh Island, disabled, and the guided-missile frigate USS Curts (FFG-38) and Navy personnel captured 51 prisoners and raised the U.S. and Kuwaiti flags on Kuwaitâs first soil to be freed. (See âWhen the Liberation of Kuwait Began,â page 51, April 1991 Proceedings.)</p>"+
   "<p>The air war turned to the task of destroying Iraqi airfields, SAMs, and chemical/biological warfare facilities. The key objective of this phase was to ensure a threat-free environment over the Kuwaiti theater of operations in anticipation of starting Phase III, battlefield preparation. The elusive Scud ballistic-missile launchers became a real issue, and âScud CAPsâ were created in order to pounce on a launch site before additional launches could be accomplished or the mobile rail launcher returned to a safe hiding area. Scud versus Scud CAP became a true cat-and-mouse game â one that continued right up to the end of the campaign.</p>"+
   "<p>Back at sea, the Iraqi Navy, which had remained in port for most of the buildup period, decided to make a run for it instead of being sunk at the pier. Thus on 30 January the Battle of Bubiyan came about, and of the approximately 20 ships that tried to make it to Iran, only one damaged Osa-II missile patrol boat got through it. At this time, there is no explanation why those ships carrying Exocet and Styx antiship missiles went to the bottom, rather than try for a lucky hit. The stage was now set to conduct minesweeping and amphibious operations, with Silkworms posing the primary threat.</p>"+
   "<p>The Iraqi Air Force had run, their navy had tried to run, and all that remained were their ground forces. The tempo of sorties increased to hundreds a day; then on 24 February, the ground campaign launched. Several amphibious assault options were available, but it was necessary only to use feints to hold the Iraqi defenses in position. Visiting the Kuwaiti coastline, one can see how strongly Saddam Hussein was convinced that the allies were going to come ashore. In their shore-bombardment role, the battle wagons were superb. More than 1,000 16-inch projectiles rained down on the Iraqi positions. At the end, Iraqi soldiers were even surrendering to the remotely piloted vehicles. Getting the battleships into firing position through the previously swept minefields cost us hits on the USS Tripoli (LPH-10) and Princeton (CG-59), but their heroic crews kept them in the fight until we could relieve them and get them into local shipyards for repair.</p>"+
   "<p>When all the analysts start to pick Desert Storm apart they must carefully understand and account for the boundary conditions: modern port facilities, large and numerous airfields, and an enemy whose military did not believe in their mission and who never gave it their best shot. We should never overestimate the success of our weapon systems, but we must never underestimate the quality, dedication, and confidence of our fine young men and women. No matter what level of effort Saddam could have thrown at our Coalition forces, the outcome would have been the same â An Allied Victory.</p>"+

   intro: "As law enforcement agencies navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and increased calls for social justice after the death of George Floyd in May 2020, agencies with robust community engagement programs have had more successful public health education efforts and have maintained continuity of care with hard-to-reach communities. ",
   articleHTML: "<p>As law enforcement agencies navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and increased calls for social justice after the death of George Floyd in May 2020, agencies with robust community engagement programs have had more successful public health education efforts and have maintained continuity of care with hard-to-reach communities. Still, some challenges remain for these agencies. The Hennepin County Sheriffâs Office (HCSO) and its law enforcement and community partners are facing these challenges head on.</p>"+
   "<p>Hennepin County is the most populous county in Minnesota, with just under 1.3 million residents. Over 450,000 residents speaking a second languageâincluding Spanish, Somali, Arabic, Polish, Hmong and Vietnamese. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, HCSO, under the leadership of Sheriff David Hutchinson, saw the continuing need to build stronger, more trusting relationships with all the communities it serves. To meet this need, in 2020, HCSO formed a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TuxHF7v7aw\" target=\"_blank\">Community Outreach Division</a> staffed with a captain, several licensed peace officers and civilians. Its efforts include outreach to youth, in-person educational outreach, social media platforms, water safety awareness and partnering with other organizations to focus on livability issues for the most vulnerable residents in the county. This division also maintains continuous engagement with diverse organizations and community leaders of color. </p>"+
   "<p><strong>Community education & COVID-19 guidance.</strong> During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, HCSO determined that a community <em>education</em>, rather than enforcement, approach was the best way to fully convey the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations. Using its previously existing relationships, HCSO was able to reach out to vulnerable populations that would be hardest hit by the pandemic. HCSO invited Somali and Muslim Imams from across Minnesota, not just Hennepin County, to a virtual meeting to provide more education about the pandemic and discuss strategies for keeping their communities safe. County officials, public health officials and HCSO worked together to visit homeless encampments to deliver food, face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), with the goal of educating people experiencing homelessness about the pandemic.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Effects of COVID-19 on community engagement.</strong> While HCSO was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01f-0rYBoA\" target=\"_blank\">able to adapt</a> much of its community engagement efforts to a virtual platform, certain interactions just cannot be substituted in a virtual format. For example, HCSOâs Senior Community Engagement Specialist, Abdi Mohamed, has received multiple calls about the jail tours and Citizen Academies that HCSO usually hosts. During these events, HCSO discusses gang violence and opioid issues and works on recruitment for youth interested in careers in law enforcement. However, HCSO currently can only engage with youth via Zoom or telephone. </p>"+
   "<p>The pandemic has also forced HCSO to use technology to engage with hard-to-reach populations. While many segments of the population in Hennepin County have been able to adapt to the virtual lifestyle, some residents have not had access. Since the libraries, community centers, mosques and coffee shops are closed, the pandemic has posed new challenges for community engagement, particularly in cultures that value one-on-one relationships.</p>"+
   "<p><strong>Regional challenges and the importance of having strong community ties.</strong> The killing of George Floyd by a now-former Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officer in Hennepin County sparked social unrest around the world. The pandemic affected law enforcement agenciesâ abilities to engage with their communities, forcing them to rely largely upon existing relationships to navigate the period of social unrest. The extensive work HCSO has undertaken to deepen its community relationships proved beneficial to the safety of both the officers and the community, as community leaders exercised their first amendment rights while also stepping in to help mitigate othersâ unsafe actions during the period of civil unrest.</p>"+
   "<p>In 2017, when a Somali MPD officer was arrested and later convicted of shooting a U.S.-Australian dual citizen, HCSO conducted outreach to immigrant communities to shed light on the criminal justice process and the roles of some of the key stakeholders, such as the Sheriff, county attorney and judges. This outreach and education helped to ease residentsâ fears about the criminal justice system. </p>"+
   "<p>HCSOâs robust community engagement program can serve as a model for law enforcement agencies nationwide. The agencyâs ability to educate residents about the COVID-19 pandemic, disseminate PPE and work within its well-established relationships with the community to navigate a virtual environment, all during periods of social unrest, sets a standard for other law enforcement agencies looking to engage with their communities.</p>"+

   "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic posed unique COOP planning and implementation challenges. Agencies used their COOP Pandemic Annexes to implement COOP tactics (e.g., telework and alternate locations, reduction in scope of the work) and used COOP language describing how to maintain organizational resilience, workforce protection and continuity of programs. An informal survey of continuity managers told an important story: there are big inconsistencies in how agencies implemented COOP during the pandemic. Many agencies stepped up their traditional COOP training, but in some cases this further confused staff, as that training focuses on one of the most important elements of traditional COOP: relocation of certain staff and a shift in focus from daily activities to the agenciesâ mission-essential functions. Traditional COOP assumes that government workplaces are destroyed, but the COVID-19 pandemic presented a different challenge. COVID-19 did result in a massive relocation of federal workersâto their homes. Some employees did not know if they were operating under a formal COOP activation or some other condition. Most agencies continued with their statutory missions, functions and programs and did COVID-19 response work. Meanwhile, they increased their monitoring of events that could trigger a formal COOP activation. There is a gray area between COOP program implementation in a disaster like COVID-19 and âtraditionalâ formal COOP implementation. Part of the gray area is how COOP is defined in the context of a sustained incident with no effect on physical infrastructure. Defining this limited COOP is the critical first step in ensuring that COOP practices are a daily activity, rather than an extraordinary action.</p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>Are the wargames conducted for the Department of Defense good enough? That question has been getting some attention lately. It might not be the right question.</p>"+
   "<p>Wargame sponsors do not need a better widget, a smoother experience, or a perfectly designed wargame. The officers who request CNA wargames are very rarely interested in the perfect methodology for their problems. They need real, actionable recommendations on very hard, ill-defined problems, and they needed those solutions âyesterday.â Both defense analysts like myself and the DOD sponsors who use our services have limited time and attention to devote to finding the right solution.</p>"+
   "<p>The question of whether the quality of defense wargaming is good enough â or indeed whether wargaming actually works â was most recently raised by two analysts, <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2021/02/is-the-department-of-defense-making-enough-progress-in-wargaming/\" target=\"_blank\">Yuna Wong and Garrett Heath</a>. This line of inquiry is valid, but it fails to consider the broader ecosystem in which wargaming resides. Focusing on the methods internal to wargames risks missing the point of holding wargames at all.</p>"+
   "<p>Adding more layers of bureaucracy and quality control does not solve the problems of those seeking answers through wargames. Outcomes are the important issue. Do our wargames provide a window into a useful reality? If so, weâve done our jobs correctly. In fact, raising methodology â how we wargame â with our DOD sponsors not only misses the point of defense analysis, it clouds our conversations with them. </p>"+
   "<p>Debates over the definitions of a wargame can actually distract the military from more important questions. One command asked CNA for help with a big, underspecified problem. As part of the proposed study plan, CNA recommended a large tabletop exercise. The analysts at the command later noted that the tabletop exercise had been renamed as an âevent.â Asked why, they said they wanted to avoid an argument with participants over the definition of a wargame versus a tabletop exercise. In other words, as part of the decision calculus to solve a very hard problem, a sponsor was taking the time to weigh pushback from participants over whether an event met the right âcheckboxesâ to qualify as a wargame â instead of trying to solve their important problem. </p>"+
   "<p>Involving DOD in the arguments over how to build a better wargame widget does not answer the questions they face from the whole of government. Congress recently asked one of CNAâs sponsors how wargames have affected long-term procurement and plans. This question is hard to answer, and the sponsor reached out to CNA for help. What the sponsor needed was a statement about effects, not the methods of each of the wargames. Focusing on the methods would only detract from the effort to answer the inquiry. </p>"+
   "<p>If a focus on verifying that wargames use the ârightâ tools can distract decision-makers from actually solving defense problems, whatâs the effect on the analysis community? </p>"+
   "<p>Discussing methods, rigor and proper approaches to analysis is key to what we, as defense analysts, do. But when that conversation overwhelms and supplants our efforts to address the broader problems that the Department of Defense must solve, wargamers and analysts have failed in their jobs. There are dangers in mistaking rigorous wargaming for effective wargaming. </p>"+
   "<p>As many defense analysts are fond of saying, âAll models are wrong, some models are useful.â The usefulness of a wargame is not in its methods, but in its outputs. </p>"+

   articleHTML: "<p>The pace of developments in Afghanistan has created stark choices for the Biden administration. In recent weeks and months, many commentators have penned op-eds arguing for or against certain policy options. Broadly speaking, these arguments fall into one of three categories: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/opinion/biden-afghanistan-war.html?searchResultPosition=1\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing all forces</a> by the May 1 deadline agreed to in the February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement, ignoring this deadline given Taliban malpractice and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22327124/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-lisa-curtis-stay\" target=\"_blank\">keeping a small U.S. presence</a> in the country, or negotiating a <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2021/02/how-to-bargain-with-the-taliban/\" target=\"_blank\">one-time extension</a> to the May 1 deadline to make progress in the U.S.-Afghan government peace talks. However, many of these arguments have failed to assess the risks inherent in their preferred course, which is a crucial aspect of policymaking.</p>"+
   "<p>This piece introduces the most prevalent points made in support of these choices, then explores the risks associated with them. In identifying these risks, we aim to provide policymakers with more data to make informed decisions.</p>"+
   "<h3>Option 1: Withdrawal</h3>" +
   "<p>Those who favor a withdrawal of U.S. forces by the May 1 deadline typically employ several points to support their argument. They point to the cost of the war, the limited strategic value of Afghanistan as compared to other parts of the globe, or the value of honoring agreements. </ap>"+
   "<p>Each of these points represents a valid concern that the U.S. should consider. However, taken together, the decision to withdraw forces by May 1 would bring substantial risks in several key areas. First, if the U.S. withdraws its forces by this date and the Taliban-Afghan government peace talks fall apart, it risks jeopardizing its ability to pursue its counterterrorism (CT) interests in Afghanistan. Without a sustained presence on the ground, the U.S. would need to either retain the ability to surge CT capabilities from somewhere outside Afghanistan or rely on its Afghan partners. Neither option is ideal. And while the extent to which terrorist groups in Afghanistan have the capability and the intent to strike American interests abroad remains an open question, failure to put sufficient pressure on these groups would open the door for potential blowback down the road.</p>"+
   "<p>Second, withdrawing forces by May 1 without significant progress in the Taliban-Afghan government peace talks would likely result in the breakdown of those talks. Since the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country is one of the Talibanâs main demands (as evidenced by its centrality in the U.S.-Taliban agreement), the Taliban would have little incentive to continue peace talks with the Afghan government after a troop withdrawal. This would stymie the best chance for a lasting peace in Afghanistan since the current conflict began. Additionally, a breakdown of talks would lead to increased violence in a country already experiencing daily attacks. <a href=\"https://www.khaama.com/afghanistan-to-plunge-into-civil-war-if-peace-talks-fail-mohib-4535366/\" target=\"_blank\">Some claim</a> all-out civil war would follow. Even if that is avoided, there is no doubt that bloodshed would increase.</p>"+
   "<p>Third, the withdrawal of U.S. forces would undoubtedly set back the progress made on womenâs rights and the rights of minority groups. The current assassination and intimidation campaign targeting women and prominent members of civil society would likely continue and may worsen if the Afghan government proves unable to curb the violence. The degree to which the Taliban have shifted their views on the rights of women is highly debatable. If the group were to regain control of the country, women in Afghanistan would suffer.</p>"+
   "<h3>Option 2: Residual force</h3>"+
   "<p>Those who believe that the U.S. should stay in Afghanistan past the deadline highlight reports that the Taliban are failing to adhere to their commitments, the sustainability of a small U.S. CT footprint, the need to for the U.S. to stand by its Afghan partners or the need to protect womenâs rights.</p>"+
   "<p>Similar to option one, each point made in support of this argument has its merits and risks. First, there are opportunity costs associated with staying. While some may point to the $4 to 5 billion that the U.S. invests each year in building the capabilities of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) as sustainable, the actual costs of operating in Afghanistan are much higher. The Department of Defense (DOD) fiscal year 2020 request for funding for operations in Afghanistan was $19 billion. Even if we assume that number declines with decreased force levels, the cost of operations plus U.S. funding for the ANDSF will likely hover around $20 billion per year, a considerable sum.</p>"+
   "<p>Second, the distribution of U.S. forces that would likely remain in Afghanistan is not equitable across the Joint Force. U.S. special operations forces (SOF) have maintained a large footprint in Afghanistan for the last 20 years. They have deployed at a near constant rate, and former acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller claimed that SOF are likely to be the last forces left in Afghanistan. Yet, as evidenced by the release of the National Defense Strategy, the DOD is focused on other challenges. If DOD wants SOF to focus on great power competition challenges, it will need to reconsider the current distribution of forces, or it will risk being unable to pivot.</p>"+
   "<p>Third, a continued U.S. presence risks perpetuating a declining status quo that characterizes the current situation in Afghanistan. Currently, U.S. and coalition forces are not sufficient to stem the tide of the Talibanâs offensive actions in Afghanistan. Nor are they designed to. With the formal end of combat operations in 2014, the U.S. and coalition shifted to a mission of training, advising and assisting the ANDSF. Yet this has come at the expense of security in the country, which has deteriorated in recent years. A continued U.S. presence on the ground will likely ensure that the Taliban will not be able to completely overrun the country, yet will be unable to deliver an ANDSF victory. Simply put, in the absence of a viable peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government, a continued U.S. presence will coincide with continued violence. While the U.S. will suffer relatively few casualties, Afghans will continue to die in droves.</p>"+
   "<h3>Option 3: Breaking the all-or-nothing duality</h3>"+
   "<p>Between the options to stay or go, a growing group of outside observers are arguing to negotiate a one-time extension to the timelines laid out in the U.S.-Taliban agreement or to advance an ambitious new agenda for peace. </p>"+
   "<p>Despite the potential benefits of jumpstarting the current stalled process, changing the terms of the U.S.-Taliban agreement entails considerable risk. First, the Taliban are unlikely to agree to modify or abandon the U.S.-Taliban agreement without additional concessions. Some have suggested that removing current U.S. sanctions on certain Taliban members could serve as this concession. Indeed, the Taliban has long desired the elimination of these sanctions, and the U.S.-Taliban agreement includes a clause requiring the U.S. to <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf\" target=\"_Blank\">undertake a review</a> of them. The U.S. could agree to formally remove its sanctions in return for Taliban participation in a new peace process.</p>"+
   "<p>However, there is no guarantee that, having secured an extension to the agreement, the Taliban will adhere to it. The Taliban could play for time and wait until the U.S. reaches its new troop withdrawal deadline. Were this to occur, the U.S. would gain nothing while giving away something valuable. </p>"+
   "<p>Third, extending the deadline for the U.S. will require the Biden administration to make a foreign policy decision about Afghanistan, instead of simply adhering to the U.S.-Taliban agreement negotiated under the previous administration. This may increase the chances that, upon further review, the U.S. decides that it cannot or should not fully withdraw its troops. In other words, now may be the best time for the Biden administration to make good on its pledge to exit the conflict without domestic political consequences.</p>"+
   "<h3>Conclusion</h3>"+
   "<p>It has become an old adage that there is no good option in Afghanistan. While the statement may be accurate, this attitude also encourages perpetual inaction. All options are fraught with risk. Advocating for a policy option without highlighting its risks does policymakers a disservice. However, identifying and explaining the inherent risk in all likely options can lead to a more productive discussion about U.S. interests in Afghanistan and the risks the U.S. is willing to accept to secure these interests.</p>"+

   intro: "While concerns about the threat of terrorism have dominated conversations about national security for nearly two decades now, the nature of the threat to Americans has slowly been shifting.",
   articleHTML: "<p>While concerns about the threat of terrorism have dominated conversations about national security for nearly two decades now, the nature of the threat to Americans has slowly been shifting. Islamist terrorists still kill thousands of people every year, but in recent years, they have posed little threat to the American homeland. According to an <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Anti-Defamation League report</a>, in 2019, violent Islamists were not linked to a single domestic extremist killing. By contrast, violent right-wing extremists were linked to 90 percent of domestic extremist killings in 2019. And critically, as one expert <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/news/news-articles/2017/conversation-charlottesville.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a>, âMurders and other violent attacks perpetrated by U.S. far-right extremists compose the visible tip of an iceberg. The rest of this iceberg is under water and out of sight. It includes hundreds of attacks every year that damage property and intimidate communities.â</p>"+
   "<p>None of this is news to those working on terrorism. On March 3, FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fbi-chris-wray-testify-capitol-riot-9a5539af34b15338bb5c4923907eeb67\" target=\"_blank\">testified</a> to the Senate Judiciary Committee that, âThe problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now and itâs not going away anytime soon.â He went on to note that the number of investigations had almost doubled (from about 1,000 to about 2,000)âand the number of arrests had almost tripledâsince 2017. </p>"+
   "<p>In the wake of the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, though, and under the guidance of a new administration, a veritable avalanche of op-eds and analytic pieces have been written about the threat posed by right-wing violent extremists. Some of these contain sound advice; others are troublingly reactionary. The issue is complicated, and there are no simple approaches, but the lessons of the past two decades make it possible to articulate a few clear guiding principles for navigating the coming weeks, months and years. </p>"+
   "<p><strong><em>First, the U.S. should resist the temptation to declare war on right-wing violent extremism.</em></strong> America is problematically fond of declaring wars. We have, since the Nixon presidency, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/102751/romney-obama-war-dogs-nouns-drugs-fehrnstrom\" target=\"_blank\">waged or navigated wars on a laundry list</a> of social and political concerns including poverty, hunger, drugs, cancer, terror, Christmas and women. It is hard, though, to identify an instance in which this language was genuinely helpful. Instead, it imports a host of troubling paradigms and approaches that are often counterproductive. It predisposes Americans to aggression (instead of compassion), to fight (instead of negotiate) and to demonize (instead of humanize). This isnât to suggest that the response to domestic terrorism should be unconditional compassion; terrorism is a horrible tactic that takes innocent lives and destroys families. However, a one-dimensionally aggressive and demonizing approach was a <a href=\"/cna_files/pdf/DRM-2017-U-015710-2Rev.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">counterproductive strategy</a> when our issue was with Islamist extremism, and the negative consequences will be similarly problematic when we approach our friends and neighbors this way.</p>"+
   "<p><strong><em>Second, we must be nuanced in our understanding of the difference between holding extremist ideas and committing violent actions in support of these ideas.</em></strong> Holding extremist ideas is a right guaranteed to every American; committing violent actions in support of these ideas is not. As we move forward, it is critical that we differentiate between those who hold extremist ideas (which is legal) and those who commit violent acts in support of these ideas (which is illegal). This isnât to suggest that extremist ideas arenât an issue; those who engage in violent extremist actions almost always hold extremist ideologies. But critically, most extremist ideologues do not commit acts of violence. White supremacy, as just one example, is a pernicious and abhorrent ideology that has plagued America since its earliest days and that advocates for structurally and systemically violent systems, but only a small percentage of white supremacists commit acts of political violence or domestic terrorism. Differentiating between the violent and the non-violent wonât be easy, and some will want to argue that membership in an extremist organization constitutes active participation in political violence. This is a complex issue with no simple solutions. As just one example, white supremacists have made sporadic calls for an NAAWPâa National Association for the Advancement of White Peopleâfor over 50 years. Such an organization would presumably advance a structurally and systemically violent social structure, but such an organization would also presumably disavow political violence and domestic terrorism in favor of seeking redress via legislation and policy. There is an urgent need to address both types of violence, but the problem of structurally and systemically violent systems is different from the problem of violent extremism or domestic terrorism. Each will, as a result, require a different solution and we will likely do more harm than good if we conflate them. Doing so, in fact, risks radicalizing additional people, much as the U.S. contributed to the radicalization of a subset of the Iraqi population as a result of its clumsy 2003 intervention. The government cannot be in the business of regulating what people think; it can only respond to the illegal actions that they take.</p>"+
   "<p><strong><em>Third, we should protect against and prosecute actions, and we should avoid discussions that focus on intentions.</em></strong> It will be tempting, as we see our neighbors and colleagues and relatives on trial, to judge them based on their intentions. This is, in fact, already happening, as a defense attorney for a woman arrested with connection to January 6 U.S. Capitol attack recently argued, \"However misguided, her intentions were not in any way related to an intention to overthrow the government, but to support what she believed to be the lawful government. She took an oath to support the Constitution and had no intention of violating that oath or of committing any violent acts.\"  The argument, in short, is a request that we ignore her (allegedly illegal) actions and focus instead on her (allegedly patriotic) intentions. It is, in some ways, a version of the approach that we took in the post-9/11 era, when we allowed our biases to rule. In that era, Americans amplified religious and racial differences and saw the worst in others; in this moment, we risk amplifying ideological similarities and seeing the bestâexcusing illegal actions on the grounds of the perpetratorâs intent. A personâs intentions are not irrelevant (e.g., a murder committed with the intention to save oneâs own life is different from a murder committed with the intention to steal a car), but the highly polarized and partisan nature of the moment will almost certainly impede our ability to judge without bias. If we allow ourselves to become ensnared in conversations about intentions, we risk further inflaming the partisan divide by treating our ideological allies sympathetically and our ideological foes harshly. Focusing on actions, by contrast, provides a more impartial path forward and may help to restore faith in the rule of law. </p>" +
   "<p>The path forward will be difficult, complicated and painful for a host of reasons. The good news is that we have learned an immense amount in the years since 9/11. Unfortunately, not everything we did after 9/11 was productive. Replicating the mistakes that we made in the last two decadesâadopting a war mentality, conflating violent actions and extremist beliefs, and allowing bias to influence our assessmentsâwill likely make the situation worse. </p>"+

While the new command is largely an outgrowth of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, it will also make some notable changes from the way the Air Force did business. These changes make good sense today and set the Space Force up for the future.",
   articleHTML: "<p>Last week, just a few months into its second year of existence, the Space Force <a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article/2565803/space-systems-command-geared-to-deliver-swift-responsive-space-capabilities/\">unveiled its design</a> and intentions for its primary acquisition organization, the Space Systems Command. While the new command is largely an outgrowth of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, it will also make some notable changes from the way the Air Force did business. These changes make good sense today and set the Space Force up for the future.</p>" +
   "<p><strong>Tying acquisition to both service chief and secretariat chains.</strong> The Space Systems Command will be run by a three-star general who is a direct report to the four-star Chief of Space Operations. However, acquisition oversight is delegated to subordinates (program executive officers) who will report to the service acquisition executive in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. In its prior configuration as Space and Missile Systems Center, the three-star general commander served as the program executive officer for Space over top of subordinate executives; that additional layer appears to have been eliminated in the Space Systems Command structure. The Navy similarly configures its systems commands with senior leaders reporting to the service chief and subordinate program executive officers report to the service secretaryâs office. It makes good sense: having lines back to both the service chief and secretariat helpfully links space acquisitionâa service secretary responsibilityâwith space operator needsâsomething more fully appreciated by the uniformed service chief. Indeed, we recommended both of these design decisions in CNAâs <a href=\"https://www.cna.org/cna_files/PDF/SpaceForceExecutiveSummary.pdf\"> congressionally mandated plan for a Department of the Space Force </a> , drafted before the new service was formally created.</p><p> The stability of the Space Systems Command structure and service chief leadership will also be important. This stability helps at a time when other aspects of space acquisition are still in flux. Last May, the Department of the Air Force quickly retracted a required proposal to Congress on space acquisition; a new one has not yet been delivered. Indeed, the Biden administration has not yet nominated someone to fill the seat of Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, and the acquisition executive responsibilities are not scheduled to transfer from the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to the one for Space until October 2022.</p><p> <strong> Maintaining innovation and mature acquisition as separate activities. </strong> The new design also maintains the Space Development Agency and Rapid Capability Office â two activities conducting disruptive and innovative acquisition â as distinct entities. This decision will allow them to flourish under separate leaders, processes, cultures and budgets than those of Space Systems Command. Keeping innovation and mature acquisition activities separate is a fundamental business principle of âorganizational ambidexterity.â And making these two disruptive entities direct reports to the Chief of Space Operations will allow for the top-cover necessary for successful innovation. These choices, too, reflect recommendations we made in CNAâs design.</p><p> Looking ahead, maintaining the two innovation-focused organizations as distinct from the Space Systems Command will make it easier to merge them in the future without creating undue change to the command. There is still some role ambiguity and overlap between the Space Development Agency, responsible for â<a href=\"https://www.sda.mil/\">next-generation National Defense Space Architecture</a>,â and the Rapid Capability Office, which develops innovative â<a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/2464030/space-rapid-capabilities-office/\" >operationally dominant space capabilities at the speed of warfighting relevance</a>.â When the Space Development Agency moves from its current place with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering over to the Space Force, it could be consolidated with the Rapid Capability Office while maintaining ambidexterity. In our congressionally mandated plan, we suggested the creation of a Space Innovation Center, merging those two staffs and other space-specific science and technology activities currently at the Air Force Research Laboratory to create a truly unique innovation incubator with a direct line to the office of the Secretary.</p><p ><strong>Realigning launch for realities of today and tomorrow.</strong> Perhaps most significantly, the Space Systems Command design realigns launch activities from Space Operations Command to the acquisition arm for the Space Force. This choice acknowledges that launch is essentially a means of delivering systems into orbit, rather than an operational activity itself. It also acknowledges the role that the launch vehicle developers â government contractors â have in executing launches.</p><p >As launch offerings, providers and volume continue to grow, the Space Force could one day provide logistics services to the joint force via suborbital and orbital flight. The new design places launch under a two-star Space Systems Command deputy. This sets the service up to eventually carve off launch services into its own command to serve alongside the Navyâs Military Sealift Command, Air Forceâs Air Mobility Command, and Armyâs Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, providing joint logistics as a component of the unified U.S. Transportation Command.</p><p>Thus, this first organizational design of Space Systems Command is not only good for equipping the nationâs national defense at present. As the opening salvo in a longer term campaign, it sets the newest military service up for future design choices and successes as the Space Force more fully comes into its own.</p>"+

   intro: "Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields social media companies from liability for content published by others on their platforms, is the subject of a number of proposed changes from Congress. Missing from this discussion is a complete understanding of how such changes could affect a major actor in the social media environment: bots.",
   articleHTML: "<p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has entered a period of uncertainty. The legislation, which shields social media companies from liability for content published by others on their platforms, was previously targeted by an executive order from the Trump administration that remains in effect today. Now it is the subject of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/technology/section-230-congress.html\" target=\"_blank\">a number of proposed changes</a> from Congress that would chip away at the immunity in a piecemeal fashion. Missing from this discussion is a complete understanding of how such changes could affect a major actor in the social media environment: bots. In a recent study of social media bots legislation by CNA, we find that the passing of restrictions on Section 230 could provide a major opening for malicious bots on social media. </p>"+
   "<p>The debate over Section 230 centers on the impact of these changes on social media platforms, but the effects of Section 230 changes could be significant for bots, too. Even though bots are automated programs, built to interact with humans on social media platforms, certain proposals could require companies to give each individual bot an appeal hearing before kicking it off the platform. This would be the case particularly under some Republican-proposed actions, such as those contained in the Trump administration executive order, which seeks to limit âselective censorshipâ and could cause social media companies to leave up content they otherwise would have taken down. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-06/Ending-Support-Internet-Censorship-Act-Bill-Text.pdf\" target=\"_target\">bill Republican Sen. Josh Hawley</a> of Arkansas introduced in the last Congress would allow citizens to sue platforms that censor political speech, which could lead to companies refusing to remove any content. This type of legislation could allow malicious bots to continue operating for much longer, providing a boost for those seeking to spread disinformation.</p>"+
   "<p>Unintended consequences could also work in the opposite direction. During the presidential campaign Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke\" target=\"_blank\">called for the complete repeal</a> of Section 230, though that appears less likely now, as most lawmakers appear uninterested in a full revocation of the law. If Congress were to take the step of repealing Section 230 without replacing it, social media companies could be held liable for all content posted on their platforms and might aggressively block all bots to ensure no harmful, bot-generated content slips through. The wholesale blockage of bots could ultimately result in a loss for society, however, since many bots are actually benign or beneficial. For example, the Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paritybot_US\" target=\"_blank\">@ParityBOT_US</a> sends out a positive tweet each time its algorithm âdetects an abusive tweet sent to a woman candidate running in the U.S. election.â The bot <a href=\"https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF\" target=\"_blank\">@earthquakesSF</a> distributes U.S. Geological Service data on all earthquakes detected in the San Francisco area in real time.</p>"+
   "<p>While few proposals have bipartisan support, both sides of the aisle agree that Section 230 needs reform. Concern about disinformation has only grown since the January 6 Capitol attack, which involved large numbers of QAnon believers and other conspiracy theorists who operate largely on social media. Of course the 2016 election also spurred huge interest in the topic. We now know that during that campaign, Russia widely spread contentious and often false narratives by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/19/twitter-admits-far-more-russian-bots-posted-on-election-than-it-had-disclosed\" target=\"_blank\">using over 50,000 bots on Twitter alone</a> to create profiles appearing to belong to everyday Americans. However, Congress and the Biden administration must think seriously and strategically about any reform or repeal of Section 230, considering potential unintended consequences before determining the best path forward. This undertaking begins with an appreciation of the state of the law regarding bots, as well as private enforcement efforts. Itâs difficult to be optimistic when surveying the short history of efforts to regulate social media bots. </p>"+
   "<h3>The legal landscape of bot regulation</h3>"+
   "<p>The United States currently has no federal legislation regulating social media bots, and a number of challenges and legal restrictions constrain the ability of Congress to pass meaningful bot legislation. For one, any law inhibiting the use of bots has to meet First Amendment standards, like all government-imposed speech constraints. Bot speech receives constitutional protection because individuals with First Amendment rights communicate through bots, and those on the receiving end of bot messages also have a right to take in that information. While this does not prevent Congress from passing legislation, it does create a minefield for crafting such provisions. </p>"+
   "<p>For as long as it survives, Section 230 also restrains Congress from passing legislation that would hold the social media platforms responsible for content â including bot-generated content. Even if Section 230 evolves or goes away, there are still a number of other barriers to crafting appropriately-tailored federal bot legislation, including the difficulty of identifying which accounts are run by bots and the fact that some bots are benign or beneficial.</p>"+
   "<p>Despite these difficulties, there have been attempts in Congress to pass bills to at least partially legislate the use of bots and botnets. (A botnet is a collection of coordinated social media bots, which is often more successful at amplifying narratives than the use of a single bot. For example, in the wake of the Jamal Khashoggi killing, a botnet was activated to distort the conversation and cast doubt on Saudi Arabiaâs involvement.) Notably, Sen. Dianne Feinsteinâs <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2125\" target=\"_blank\">Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act</a>, introduced in 2018 and again in 2019, would forbid the use of bots by political candidates, parties, and political action committees. It would also require bots to disclose themselves in posts and tweets. The bill is currently stuck in committee.</p>"+
   "<p>The only bot-related law to pass in the U.S. so far has been at the state level. Californiaâs <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=7.&title=&part=3.&chapter=6.&article=\" target=\"_blank\">Bolstering Online Transparency</a>, or B.O.T. Act, became operational on July 1, 2019. This law makes it illegal to use a bot to knowingly mislead a person in California about an accountâs artificial identity in order to influence their vote or persuade them to participate in a commercial transaction. It is still unclear how the state will punish users interacting with someone in California in a global commons like the internet. Other states, including New Jersey and Washington, have introduced similar bills, but they have yet to pass.</p>"+
   "<p>International bot regulation efforts, which currently center on Europe, are voluntary and non-binding. The European Union developed a Code of Practice in 2018, signed by many of the big social media companies, including Twitter and Facebook. The signatories pledged to self-regulate in a number of areas, including closing fake accounts and labeling bot interactions. In the European Commissionâs first yearly compliance findings, published in May 2020, the commission indicated there is still much room for improvement in these efforts to restrict malicious bots.</p>"+
   "<h3>Private policing on the platforms</h3>"+
   "<p>Because legislation and governmental regulation of bots is still nascent, the vast majority of bot control efforts fall to the social media platforms themselves. These companies are hardly the natural locus for such action. Bots pump up customer engagement numbers, which are linked to higher share prices. As a result, the platforms are naturally reluctant to kick off large quantities of bots. This has begun to change, however, as blowback in the wake of the 2016 election has created a greater financial and reputational incentive for the companies to stop spreaders of disinformation.</p>"+
   "<p>Another impediment to private policing is Section 230 itself. Platforms have been reluctant to moderate too heavily out of fear that doing so could amount to admitting a duty to regulate content on their sites. That would run counter to the original reasoning for Section 230: allowing sites to provide venues for online interaction without needing to employ hordes of lawyers and moderators to constantly take down offending content. The more these companies monitor content and police bots, the weaker their position to defend Section 230 on those grounds. We have seen this play out recently after Twitter labeled tweets by President Trump that it deemed inaccurate. This led the administration to pass its executive order on Section 230 reform, because, according to the order, such moderation means the sites âcease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.â</p>"+
   "<p>Despite the reasons deterring social media platforms from controlling bots, they have begun to restrict the use of automation on their sites. Where Russian actors once operated virtually in plain sight, mechanisms now exist to quickly take down botnets and to stop the creation of fake accounts by bots. Twitter has introduced an automated system to help it spot bot activity, and the company has since removed networks operating out of a variety of locations, including Russia, China, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Despite great improvements inside the social media companies, difficulties remain, and it can be challenging even for them to distinguish between bot and human activity. As the companies implement new systems, actors are simultaneously evolving their tactics to try to avoid detection, including the use of AI-generated profile photos rather than more easily traced photos of real people.</p>"+
   "<p>Many social media sites do not have policies specifically detailing how they deal with bots, but instead fold the provisions potentially applicable to bots into their general policies on banned behavior. In the CNA bots study, we found that social media companies typically control bot behavior through four broad categories of policies: general automation, spam, artificial amplification, and fake accounts and misrepresentation.</p>"+
   "<p>This graphic shows how these policies often overlap in addressing bot behaviors. Some behavior types, like spam and artificial amplification, are completely banned (shown in green) under the policies, while general automation and fake account policies permit some types of bot-related behaviors (shown in blue) and ban others. For instance, fake account and misrepresentation policies sometimes allow for the creation of satire and entertainment accounts, while wholly banning more deceptive fake accounts. Twitter, for example, allows the creation of joke accounts set up to impersonate celebrities, like one tweeting as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Queen_UK?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">âQueen Elizabethâ</a> with over 1.5 million followers, as long as the account biography makes clear it is unaffiliated with the account subject. At the same time, Twitterâs <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-impersonation-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Impersonation Policy</a> prohibits any attempt to pass as another individual in âa confusing or deceptive manner.â</p>"+
   "<img src=\"/CNA_files/InDepth/Post84-figure.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" />"+
   "<h3>The way forward</h3>"+
   "<p>Until now, there has been very little real movement toward meaningful bot regulation, leaving bots largely unregulated, at least from a governmental standpoint. It is unlikely Congress will find a legislative solution to the malicious use of bots in the near future, though they will continue to drag tech CEOs up to Capitol Hill to testify on the measures their companies are implementing to combat these problems. At the same time, proposals to regulate the social media companies themselves have increasingly gained traction, with likely reform or repeal of Section 230 looming in the near future. Those changes could have major implications for the bots that operate on them, though whether it becomes easier or much harder for bots to operate will depend on how the conversation shakes out.</p>"+
   "<p>Bots should be an important component of the national discussion on social media and disinformation. These automated accounts participate in our social discourse on a wide range of topics. As narratives spread, bots can even affect the conversation outside of the social media realm. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/20/are-bots-manipulating-conversation-heres-whats-changed-since/\" target=\"_blank\">According to Nick Monaco</a>, research director at the Institute for the Futureâs Digital Intelligence Lab, there is ânever something thatâs trending thatâs not in some way promoted by bots.â However, bots are not inherently malicious, just as they are not inherently effective at spreading narratives. Rather, it is the intent of the programmer and the employment of the bots that determine where they fall on the scale of good to bad. As the conversation on the future of social media continues, decision-makers would do well to consider bots in all of their complexity. </p>" +

                                        Both US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin aim to
                                        halt the downward spiral of the bilateral relationship when they meet on
                                        June 16 in Geneva, Switzerland. Biden has noted the importance of a 
                                        "<a target="_blank"
                                        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/05/joe-biden-europe-trip-agenda/"

                                        >Putin told NBC</a>, "It is my great hope that â¦ there will not be any impulse-based
                                        movements." The fact that the meeting is taking place indicates that both
                                        sides are interested in predictability and ensuring that any further
                                        deterioration of bilateral relations doesn't lead to conflict. But we see
                                        five significant points of contention between Moscow and Washington that
                                        are likely to be on the agenda in Geneva and persist after the meeting.

                                    <p>
                                        A series of Russian actions have led to worsening diplomatic relations
                                        since 2014. The most high-profile domestic issue has been Russian
                                    interference in the U.S. electoral process. In 2016, this <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">included</a>
                                        email leaks, the targeting of state election systems, and social media
                                        propaganda to "undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,
                                        denigrate [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential
                                        presidency," as the U.S. intelligence community concluded. In the 2018 and
                                        2020 U.S. elections, Russia appears

                                        The U.S. response to Russian actions has involved economic sanctions,

                                        in reversing Russian behavior. Washington and Moscow have also engaged in
                                        reciprocal closures of consular facilities and have expelled significant
                                        numbers of diplomatic personnel, which has dramatically slowed consular

                                        Another significant issue has been Russia's destabilizing behavior in
                                        Europe. Since Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea,
                                        the ensuing peace process has largely stalled. In March, Russia 
                                        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russian-troop-buildup-along-ukraines-border">deployed</a>
                                        100,000 troops to its border with Ukraine, raising concerns about a
                                        dramatic military escalation. Russian intelligence operatives appear to
                                    have taken a series of brazen steps against U.S. allies, including an    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51722301" target="_blank">attempted assassination</a>

                                        information warfare and propaganda campaigns, the U.S. and allies have
                                        introduced sanctions, adopted a stronger military deterrence posture in the
                                        region, and provided military aid to Ukraine.

                                        Russia. Most recently, the focus has been on the fate of Russian opposition
                                        politician Alexey Navalny, who evidently sustained a

                                        affiliated from running for office. Russian authorities have further
                                        constrained free speech by labeling certain news outlets, online
                                        information sources and blogs as "foreign agents."

                                    <p>
                                        A key challenge in the bilateral relationship is Russia-based cybercrime.
                                        The ransomware attack that recently

                                        was traced to DarkSide â a hacking group presumably based in Russia.
                                        Another Russian-speaking cybercriminal gang, REvil, recently targeted U.S.
                                        operations of the meatpacking company JBS, resulting in a

                                        Though the Russian government has not been directly linked to these
                                        cyberattacks, the Biden administration has accused Moscow of not adequately
                                        cracking down on cybercrime. Secretary of State Antony Blinken

                                        >recently said</a>, "No responsible country should be in the business of harboring in any way

                                        are looking for Russian cooperation in dealing with these criminal

                                        These cases are only the latest in a growing trend of Russia-originated
                                        cyberattacks. The most serious of these was the 2020 Solar Winds hack,

                                    <p>
                                        Perhaps the most significant challenge faced by the U.S. and Russia
                                        involves maintaining strategic stability between the two largest nuclear
                                        weapons states. Both countries are in the process of modernizing their
                                        nuclear arsenals. In January, Washington and Moscow 
                                        <a target="_blank"
                                            href="https://www.politico.eu/article/putin-and-biden-confirm-extension-of-new-start-treaty/"
                                        >agreed</a> 
                                        to a five-year extension of the New START treaty, which caps each country's
                                        deployed strategic nuclear weapons to 1,550. While this is a valuable first
                                        step, there are a number of unaddressed concerns that fall outside the
                                        scope of that agreement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Many in the U.S. and NATO believe that Russia's stockpiles of shorter-range
                                        "nonstrategic" nuclear weapons should be constrained by a treaty as well.
                                        There is also worry about Russia's "exotic" nuclear weapons, such as a
                                        high-yield, nuclear-armed torpedo. Russia, for its part, has been concerned
                                        about U.S. strategic conventional capabilities and has long sought
                                        limitations on U.S. missile defense systems. Mutual strategic stability
                                        concerns include emerging military technologies: artificial intelligence,
                                        hypersonic weapons, and space capabilities that target satellite-based
                                        nuclear command, control and communications. China's growing nuclear
                                        arsenal, which is not constrained by any arms control agreements, is an
                                        additional source of U.S. worry. Reaching consensus on new constraints may
                                        be challenging, particularly given the recent demise of arms control and
                                        security agreements such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty
                                        and the Open Skies Treaty.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The way Biden and Putin choose to address these key challenges will set the
                                        stage for next steps in the bilateral relationship. While strategic
                                        stability and cyber security may eventually prove to be fruitful areas for
                                        progress, it's likely that human rights and the situation in Ukraine will
                                        be much more intractable. But, in an atmosphere of low expectations, merely
                                        putting the brakes on the downward spiral may meet a limited definition of
                                        "success."

<h3>from the <i>not-so-innovative-I-guess</i> dept</h3><div class="byline"><span class="pub_date">Fri, Aug 20th 2021 5:36am</span> &mdash;
<a href="/user/kbode">Karl Bode</a></div>
<p>
To be clear, wireless carrier app stores have always kind of sucked. Verizon's efforts to create its own app store were <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/11/05/verizon-app-store-shut-down/">shut down in 2012</a>, after underwhelming consumers for years. At the time, the narrative was that Verizon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/5/3605618/verizon-apps-store-closing-january-2013">just didn't find it worth the trouble</a> in the face of Google domination and innovation. And while that's still largely true (wireless carriers are utterly unfamiliar with competition and therefore historically <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060721/0310239.shtml">suck at innovation and adaptation</a>), it turns out there was another reason.
</p>
<p>
Namely, that Google was paying Verizon and other major wireless companies a big chunk of money to <b>not</b> compete with the Android marketplace. And they were paying smartphone manufacturers to ship devices without competing app stores installed. Both nuggets were buried in a freshly unredacted copy of Epic's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.165.1.pdf">antitrust complaint</a> (pdf) against Google, first spotted by Jeremy Owens:

</p>
<p>
&mdash; Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) <a href="https://twitter.com/jowens510/status/1428425374350790671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
<p>
This agreement to start paying wireless carriers 20-25% of app sales was occurring right around the time that Google brass was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100812/17291310611.shtml">visibly starting to wimp out on consumer-centric issues like net neutrality</a>. That involved working closely with Verizon to push the FCC toward flimsy, loophole-filled, "compromise" 2010 net neutrality rules that <em><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100804/17322110501.shtml">excluded wireless entirely</a></em>. Verizon proceeded to then successfully sue the FCC to have those repealed anyway, leading to better rules in 2015 that were also dismantled a few years, later, albeit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191001/09533043103/court-says-fcc-cant-stop-states-protecting-net-neutrality.shtml">thanks to lobbying, not the courtroom</a>.
</p>
<p>
Google's shift from hugely innovative disruptor to entrenched, elbow-swinging turf protector has been a fairly ugly and historically unsurprising transition. You can clearly see the line in the sand somewhere around 2010 to throw away many of the guiding principles that made them successful and popular. There was another executive leadership pivot sometime around 2016 that brought with it increased timidity at the company (see: the company's abrupt decision to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210126/07195746119/with-loon-dead-google-fiber-frozen-googles-broadband-disruption-plays-arent-looking-so-hot.shtml">largely give up on expanding Google Fiber</a> and many other exciting moonshot projects). Then, more recently there's the whole <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research/google-fires-second-ai-ethics-leader-as-dispute-over-research-diversity-grows-idUSKBN2AJ2JA">AI ethics scandals</a>, which speaks for itself.
</p>
<p>
To be clear Google still does a lot of interesting and popular stuff, but it's pretty damn clear that the ethics and bravery that guided the company originally were obliterated some time back.
</p>
<p>
I have to think that revelations Google was paying wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers to not compete with it will likely fuel several different antitrust inquiries and court cases. Maybe wireless carriers would have always failed to develop compelling app stores of their own thanks to innate incompetence, but it's harder than ever for that to happen when Google is paying you billions of dollars to <em>not even try</em>. And then, should those competing app stores succeed, paying handset makers not to carry them anyway, even if they happen to become popular.
</p>
<p>
As a little side note, the fact Google has been paying wireless carriers billions of dollars to <b>do nothing</b> kind of puts an additional dent in FCC Commissioner's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210602/09445946912/cnet-amplifies-fccs-carrs-attempt-to-force-big-tech-to-pay-big-telecom-no-reason.shtml">ongoing, dumb claim</a> that "big tech" gets a "free ride" on telecom networks. Getting paid to do nothing is the exact kind of thing AT&#038;T has been pushing for since <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100412/0111098965.shtml">2003 or so</a>. It's the kind of stupid demand that started the net neutrality debate. Whether the payoffs violated the law is for antitrust lawyers to decide, but the fact Google repeatedly thought nothing about ignoring its original founding principles continues to speak pretty loudly either way.

<p>
Alt-right "personality" (I guess?) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=laura+loomer">Laura Loomer</a> keeps <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190316/13393641805/court-dismissed-lawsuit-brought-against-social-media-companies-alleging-anti-conservative-conspiracy.shtml">filing lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200528/11344744598/dc-appeals-court-dumps-lawsuit-claiming-multiple-tech-companies-are-engaged-anti-conservative-conspiracy.shtml">losing them</a>. Loomer seems to believe it's legally actionable to be moderated by social media services. No court has agreed with her. Between Section 230 and the First Amendment, Loomer <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200416/15055144320/facebook-tells-court-laura-loomers-defamation-allegations-all-target-protected-opinions.shtml">doesn't have a case</a>. Oblique approaches -- like claiming getting kicked off Twitter is tortious interference in a (nonexistent) business relationship (Loomer and Twitter, according to Loomer, but definitely <em>not</em> according to Twitter) -- haven't been any more successful.
</p>
<p>
Grasping at straws and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16097480/illoominate-media-inc-v-cair-florida-inc/#entry-53">switching attorneys in midstream</a> hasn't helped matters. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16097480/illoominate-media-inc-v-cair-florida-inc/">This case</a> involved Loomer trying to sue CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relationships) and Twitter in Florida, claiming CAIR's reporting of her Twitter account tortiously interfered with Loomer's get-rich-quick plan of being extremely extremist online. It only <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191120/15165743422/court-says-not-tortious-interference-to-report-your-account-ask-twitter-to-ban-you.shtml">took six pages</a> for a federal judge to dismiss Loomer's baseless claims.
</p>
<p>
By the time that dismissal happened, it was too late for Loomer. Seven months after the lawsuit was filed (in October 2019), CAIR approached Loomer and suggested a settlement under Florida state law -- one that would have been much cheaper for Loomer. Loomer refused. That has turned out to be a very expensive decision. (h/t Techdirt reader <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/thad">Thad</a>)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21038781/loomer-fees.pdf">court</a> [PDF] says the offer of judgment complied with Florida law and could have provided Loomer a quicker, cheaper way to step away from her doomed litigation. Loomer argued the offer wasn't proper because she was seeking injunctive relief in addition to monetary damages. A judgment offer would obviously have short-circuited injunctive relief. But the court points out Loomer only mentioned an injunction in the complaint and never bothered to follow up on seeking this particular form of relief.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>I find that the true relief sought against the CAIR Defendants in the Amended Complaint was only monetary damages and that the Amended Complaint makes only a &ldquo;passing reference&rdquo; to equitable relief. The only equitable relief directly mentioned in Plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint is a summary request for &ldquo;preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent defendants from continuing their unlawful conduct.&rdquo; ECF No. 1-2, at 41. During the 8 1/2 month period between the filing of the Amended Complaint (March 3, 2019) and the District Court&rsquo;s dismissal order (November 19, 2019), <strong>Plaintiffs never filed a motion for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. This evidence circumstantially shows that Plaintiffs were not actually pursuing equitable relief. And, in addition to Plaintiffs not seeking an injunction, the Amended Complaint is framed in terms of monetary damage; it repeatedly and exclusively alleges economic harm to Plaintiffs &ldquo;in an amount to be proved at trial.&rdquo;</strong></em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Monetary it is! But not the way Loomer hoped. After doing some back-of-the-filing-envelope math bringing hourly rates down from their DC levels (where CAIR is HQed) to Florida levels (where the lawsuit was originally filed), the court has some bad news for a plaintiff who arguably doesn't have enough cash on hand to buy new tires.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Accordingly, Defendants&rsquo; Motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiffs shall reimburse Defendants:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Attorneys&rsquo; Fees: $123,761.65 allocated as follows:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>CAIR Foundation, Inc. $117,297.90</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>CAIR Florida, Inc. $6,463.75</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Costs: $661.72</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's how much being this wrong costs someone who's so sure they're right they blow off a cheaper offer made months before the attorneys' fees really started racking up. I don't know how many people are still interested in Loomers' windmill tilts, but I have to imagine an eighth of a million puts a pretty good dent in her legal <a href="https://loomerlegalfund.com/">warchest</a>.

<p>
For years we've talked about how the broadband and cable industry has perfected the use of utterly bogus fees to jack up subscriber bills -- a dash of financial creativity it adopted from the banking and airline industries. Countless cable and broadband companies tack on a myriad of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170424/10470637222/comcast-under-fire-using-bullshit-fees-to-covertly-raise-rates.shtml">completely bogus fees</a> below the line, letting them advertise one rate -- then sock you with a higher rate once your bill actually arrives. These companies will then brag repeatedly about how they haven't raised rates yet this year, when that's almost never actually the case.
</p>
<p>
One <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjqa5/24-of-your-cable-tv-bill-is-just-bogus-fees-study-says">2019 Consumer Reports</a> study found that about 24% of consumer bills are comprised of bullshit fees, generating cable giants $28 billion in additional revenue annually. The problem is just as bad over in broadband (see Centurylink's utterly nonsensical <a href="https://www.centurylink.com/home/help/account/billing/taxes-fees-and-surcharges-on-your-bill/internet-cost-recovery-fee.html">"Internet Cost Recovery" fee</a>). Often cable and broadband companies will try to give such fees official-sounding names like "regulatory recovery" so that consumers falsely blame government for being nickel-and-dimed. But between TV fees, hardware fees, usage fees, and other surcharges, bundled customers dole out a small fortune every year for absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p>
It's fraud, but fraud that has somehow been normalized over decades.
</p>
<p>
I've been writing about this problem for the better part of twenty years, so it's disheartening to see the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/13/internet-cable-bills/">Washington Post still covering this bullshit</a> in 2021 without much having changed:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Most of the price hike that I didn’t expect was Comcast sneaking in additional “fees” — not taxes, just expenses related to Comcast’s cost of doing business. I’m paying $27.05 on top of my bundle price for Comcast’s cable service to carry local broadcast networks and pro sports games. Yes, my Comcast bill, [Consumer Reports senior counsel Jonathan] Schwantes said, isn’t as bad as many others he has seen, which can include 12 or more line-item fees. Some companies, he added, try to make people think their fees are government taxes, but they’re not.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Amusingly, Comcast tries to pass off falsely advertising low prices then socking users with bullshit fees as some kind of consumer benefit:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Comcast tells me this is exactly what its customers want. It said it disclosed its copious additional fees to me in various fine-print communications — though only after I entered my credit card number. “We conduct extensive consumer research and host focus groups and incorporate our findings into the way we present information to our customers, all in an effort to help ensure they have a positive experience and can easily understand the details of their service,” said Jennifer Khoury, Comcast’s chief communications officer."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
By and large, federal regulators couldn't give any less of a shit about this problem. That leaves a patchwork collection of State AGs who'll occasionally dole out some light fines and flimsy wrist slaps. But that leaves most consumers utterly unprotected from being ripped off by their local cable TV or telecom company. As you can tell from similar behavior in the banking and airline industries, the federal government, at some point, just declared it <em>perfectly okay</em> to rip people off with utterly nonsensical fees, provided you're just marginally clever about it.

<h3>from the <i>pay-me-more-to-avoid-my-nonsense</i> dept</h3><div class="byline"><span class="pub_date">Thu, Jul 15th 2021 6:35am</span> &mdash;
<a href="/user/kbode">Karl Bode</a></div>
<p>
For years, US wireless carriers have had a... somewhat nebulous relationship with the dictionary definition of "unlimited." As in, for the better part of two decades they've sold wireless data plans professing to be "unlimited," then included all manner of heavy handed limitations, often buried in mouse print. Verizon received wrist slaps for this <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2007/verizon-wireless-agrees-settle-deceptive-marketing-investigation">way back in 2007</a>. AT&#038;T recently settled accusations that it lied to consumers about the throttling limitations in the company's "unlimited" plans (impacted consumers got all of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210202/08004646165/after-years-litigation-att-customers-get-measly-22-being-lied-to-over-throttling.shtml">$22 for participating in the class action</a>).
</p>
<p>
None of these penalties were meaningful enough to really change industry behavior. AT&#038;T and Verizon for example now charge more for "unlimited" plans that don't throttle 4K or HD video. And you need to pay more if you want to use your phone and "unlimited data plan" as a mobile hotspot. Sprint at one point even tried throttling all games, music, and movies unless users <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160826/10020535353/how-is-this-not-net-neutrality-violation-sprint.shtml">paid more</a>.
</p>
<p>
Somehow we normalized <em>paying wireless providers more money</em> just to avoid arbitrary restrictions, then celebrate when they ease off even modestly. For example this week, AT&#038;T announced that users that buy the company's most expensive wireless plan ($85-per-month "Unlimited Elite) will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573847/att-unlimited-elite-data-cap-4k-streaming-phone-plan?utm_campaign=theverge&#038;utm_content=chorus&#038;utm_medium=social&#038;utm_source=twitter">no longer see their connection throttled after a set amount of usage</a>. In short, if you want AT&#038;T to get close to adhering to the dictionary definition of "unlimited," you'll need to pay more:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"AT&#038;T is adding a few more benefits to its $85-per-month top-tier unlimited plan at no added cost. Unlimited Elite subscribers will now truly have access to unlimited high-speed data and will no longer be subject to deprioritization after hitting 100GB of data per month. Customers will also get a bump from 30GB of monthly hotspot data up to 40GB as well as up to 4K video streaming — boosted from a maximum of 1080p. The new plan features will be added automatically for all current subscribers starting this week."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Network management technologies have evolved to the point where well-built modern networks can detect, adapt, and avoid congestion bottlenecks by deprioritizing select traffic with virtually no detection by the end users. So there's no real reason for many of these kinds of arbitrary restrictions to exist, outside of creating a sort of pricing funnel that shovels you to the most expensive plan if you'd simply like your connection to work normally. Yet the press has normalized this sort of thing to the point where outlets <em>applaud</em> a company for charging you more to avoid bizarre restrictions.
</p>
<p>
AT&#038;T only made this modest concession because a similar plan by T-Mobile pressured it to (read: competition). But as investors inevitably force AT&#038;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile to exploit the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191021/07263243227/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details.shtml">reduced competition</a> from the Sprint/T-Mobile merger over the next few years, you'll see more and more nickel-and-diming, less real price competition, and fewer and fewer meaningful concessions. Especially if the government can't be bothered to restore net neutrality or the FCC's authority over telecom providers.

Despite some <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210401/06581646530/biden-broadband-plan-embraces-community-broadband-stark-contrast-to-trump.shtml">bold but vague promises</a>, it's still not clear exactly where the Biden administration is going to fall on broadband policy. While the administration is promising a $100 billion investment and "bold action" on broadband, it's also oddly in no rush to appoint a permanent FCC boss, or restore the FCC consumer protection authority <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190611/13180142374/heres-why-net-neutrality-still-matters-one-year-after-repeal.shtml">gutted during the Trump administration</a>. There's also a lot of telecom industry lobbyists standing in the long stretch between the administration's promises on broadband, and actual implementation.
</p>
<p>
COVID put an extremely bright light on the US' <a href="https://www.parents.com/news/photo-of-kids-using-taco-bell-wifi-is-a-startling-reminder-of-the-digital-divide/">expensive and mediocre broadband</a>, applying more political pressure on lawmakers and regional monopolies than they've seen in a long while. That's compounded by the very correct sense that as everybody has hyperventilated over "big tech," "big telecom" has gotten away with a pretty large heist the last few years when it comes to enjoying mindless deregulation and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200616/14541444731/att-has-now-eliminated-41000-jobs-since-42-billion-trump-tax-cut.shtml">massive tax breaks</a> in exchange for, well, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170623/04530937649/att-promises-cornucopia-broadband-investmentbut-only-if-trump-gives-it-giant-tax-cut-shiny-new-merger.shtml">absolutely nothing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Enter consumer groups, which have been trying to apply more pressure by highlighting the very real cost of rampant regional monopolization, and all the empty promises of the Ajit Pai era. Free Press, for example, recently <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210510/06560246766/despite-empty-fcc-promises-broadband-prices-jumped-19-during-trump-era.shtml">released a study</a> (based largely on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics) showing that during the last four years, broadband prices grew at four times the rate of inflation during the Trump era.
</p>
<p>
AT&#038;T, Comcast, Verizon, and Charter (Spectrum) lobbyists haven't much liked that, and have been trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/white-house-doesnt-believe-isps-claims-that-prices-are-low-enough-report-says/">circulate misleading studies of their own</a> claiming that if you tilt your head and look at U.S. broadband pricing <em>just so</em>, it's an incredible and growing value:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The cable industry's top lobby group, NCTA–The Internet &#038; Television Association, this week accused advocacy groups of using "cherry-picked data." But the cable group's claims that prices are going down is contradicted by US government data showing that Americans are paying more every year. The cable lobby's argument that prices are going down relies on the price per megabit rather than the average price that consumers pay each month."
</p>
<p>
By that logic, Americans should feel lucky that they're not paying $2,800 a month for 100Mbps service. But obviously, the bandwidth needs of Americans and the bandwidth capabilities of broadband networks have steadily increased over time, even as ISPs' costs have dropped, just as the capabilities of smartphones, processors, and other technology products inexorably increase over time."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
One of the primary ways telecom giants sock captive consumers with endlessly higher prices (then pretend they're not doing this) is the use of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190930/08220643099/hidden-fees-mean-us-cable-broadband-bills-can-be-45-higher-than-advertised.shtml">misleading fees and surcharges</a> that only show up when you get your bill. So of course if you only look at the <em>advertised price</em> (which many industry studies do), or only look at the <em>price per megabit</em>, you'll get decidedly different pictures than what you'll see on actual consumer bills. But most objective studies have made it clear for many years that US consumers pay some of the highest prices for broadband in the developed world thanks to limited competition and regional monopolization.
</p>
<p>
Neither party has been seriously willing to challenge massive, politically powerful telecom monopolies. The industry's worst nightmare is meaningful rate regulation. But while that's often bandied about as some sort of apocalyptic bogeyman and ever-present threat, the reality is that's never been a serious consideration under either party. Even net neutrality rules, the now dead attempt at something <em>vaguely</em> resembling telecom monopoly oversight, went well out of its way to avoid ever meaningfully regulating the telecom sector when it comes to price via forbearance and large regulatory carve outs.
</p>
<p>
It's just not politically productive to seriously challenge, say, AT&#038;T, a company that slathers Congress in campaign contributions <b>and</b> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150815/15220831968/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner.shtml">happily spies on your own citizens for you</a>. And while the Biden administration is at least initially promising to change that narrative and lower consumer broadband prices via "bold action," it's still not really clear how that's going to actually happen, or if good intentions will survive the telecom industry lobbying <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210506/09391146742/ny-ag-proves-broadband-industry-funded-phony-public-support-attack-net-neutrality.shtml">and disinformation</a> gauntlet.

<p>
<strong>Summary: </strong>Apple controls what apps get onto iPhone and iPads via its full control over the iOS App Store. Every app (and its updates) need to be reviewed by Apple staff before it’s allowed in the store -- and Apple puts in place <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">its own rules</a> for what is and what is not allowed.
</p>
<p>
One of those rules is that Apple takes a 30% cut of any sales. That fee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html">has become somewhat controversial</a>, especially among service providers who don’t rely on the App Store for discovery, but whose customers likely come on their own -- including Spotify and Epic Games. Spotify, in particular, has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913105/spotify-apple-app-store-email">urged users to subscribe directly</a>, to avoid having to pay the additional amount per month to cover Apple’s fees. In response, Apple forbade Spotify from even mentioning that it’s cheaper to subscribe outside of the App Store, which is now a central piece of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair">an antitrust fight</a> that is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN2AW24K">ongoing in the EU</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps because of all of this, Apple has had to make decisions about whether or not to allow apps in the App Store that seek to avoid paying Apple’s cut of the fees. In August of 2020, Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic, and the founder/lead developer of the WordPress content management system, announced that the iOS app for WordPress had been frozen by Apple. The given reason was that Apple believed that WordPress was trying to avoid the fees for in-app purchases.
</p>
<div class="centered">
<a href="https://imgur.com/MRfr5t5"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MRfr5t5.png" width=400 /></a>
</div>
<p>
This was the cause of much confusion, as many <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1296889185190596608">people noted</a> that the app did not actually sell anything. While WordPress.com does offer paid hosting plans (and domain reselling), that was not a part of the WordPress app. However, as Mullenweg’s tweet showed, Apple was noting that because somewhere else in WordPress.com’s business, it sold things, that meant that WordPress had to pay it a 30% cut of those sales (even though they were outside of the app itself) in order to keep the app in the App Store.
</p>
<p>
<b>Decisions to be made by Apple:</b>
<ul>
<li>How thoroughly should the company be reviewing the business models of apps in the App Store to determine whether they can be included?</li><li>What actually constitutes an attempt to get around the App Store fee?</li><li>Will app developers take advantage of exceptions to the rules if Apple does not follow them closely?</li><li>Should the company allow alternative ways of getting apps on the phone outside of the App Store?</li>
</ul>
<b>Questions and policy implications to consider:</b>
<ul>
<li>When a company builds an entire device ecosystem, should it be able to set its own rules for what apps are allowed on the device?</li><li>Can content moderation decisions raise antitrust concerns?</li><li>Are there policy implications of a single entity reviewing what apps are allowed on a device?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Resolution:</strong> As this story got more attention, Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">apologized and restored </a>the WordPress developer account. However, its statement on the matter implied that WordPress had “removed” an option in the app to pay for hosting plans:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved. Since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app, it is now a free stand-alone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases. We have informed the developer and apologize for any confusion that we have caused.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
But users of the app say it never had any in-app purchases at all. The only thing it had were descriptions of WordPress.com Premium offerings, but no way to buy them. Mullenweg said that, before going public, he had asked Apple if removing those mentions would restore the account, and Apple had said it would not.
</p>
<p>
The reinstatement appeared to take Mullenweg by surprise.

<p>
In January of 2021, Apple also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">moved to lower the cut</a> it took for in-app payments from “small” developers (those making less than $1 million a year in annual sales) to 15%. It was also revealed that Apple quietly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions">cut a special deal</a> with Amazon to charge the retailer a 15% cut for Amazon’s Prime Video app.

<p>
When you're a natural monopoly in America you get away with a lot. Take for example Frontier Communications, which has spent the last few years stumbling in and out of bankruptcy while dodging no shortage of scandals, including allegations of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170619/09164837615/frontier-communications-caught-again-ripping-off-west-virginia-taxpayers.shtml">subsidy fraud</a>. Last year, Frontier got a light wrist slap for fraudulently charging its customers a "rental" fee for <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201221/07075845926/we-had-to-pass-law-to-stop-telecom-monopolies-charging-you-rental-fees-things-you-already-own.shtml">modems they already owned</a>. The company also paid a tiny <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200709/10552844874/washington-state-ag-fines-frontier-communications-pittance-bullshit-fees.shtml">$900,000 fine last year</a> to Washington State AG Bob Ferguson for using bogus fees to rip off the company's captive subscriber base.
</p>
<p>
Of particular annoyance in consumer complaints has been the company's $4 per month "Internet Infrastructure Surcharge," which is a completely nonsensical, bullshit charge the company levies <em>below the line</em>. The surcharge doesn't <em>really</em> go to "infrastructure" (that's what your entire bill is for). What it <b>does</b> do is give Frontier a way to continually increase consumer prices while falsely advertising a lower rate. Other ISPs engage in similar behavior with little real penalty (see CenturyLink's "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200107/07425643691/washington-oregon-fine-centurylink-completely-bogus-broadband-fees.shtml">Internet Cost Recovery</a>" fee).
</p>
<p>
While the $900,000 Washington State AG fine is semi-helpful, like most US regulatory "penalties" it's a tiny fraction of the money made via the dubious business practice. And while the company stopped charging the fee in Washington, it still charges it across the rest of its 22 state footprint. Note that Frontier has 3,735,000 broadband subscribers, each paying $4 a month in completely erroneous surcharges. That's nearly $15 million in bullshit charges in just one month, or <u>$180 million in dodgy revenue every year</u>.
</p>
<p>
Facing only a light wrist slap for the practice, Frontier seems intent on doubling down on this behavior. The company this week announced it will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/frontier-raises-sneaky-internet-infrastructure-surcharge-from-4-to-7/">bumping the fee to $7 per month</a>. Frontier attempted to explain away the bogus surcharge this way:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The increase applies to Frontier customers based on individual service packages and reflects increasing maintenance and other network costs, including the rapidly rising costs of supporting our customers' increased Internet traffic and usage, and consumer demand for greater bandwidth, services, and other requirements that affect our Internet network. Customers on price-lock and promotional pricing will not see this increase until their terms expire."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
But again, "maintenance and other network costs" is what <u>the entirety of your bill is for</u>, and the fee's real purpose is to help the iSP engage in false advertising on pricing.
</p>
<p>
Despite decades of this, federal regulators at the FCC have largely been utterly pathetic on this issue. While there was some basic rules requiring at least <em>some transparency in pricing</em> baked into the FCC's net neutrality rules, those were gutted by industry lobbyists during the Trump administration repeal. This kind of misleading pricing could also be mitigated via policies that push more competition to market, but since most US markets lack competitive options, and building more competitive options <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200902/08350945227/america-needs-to-stop-pretending-broadband-digital-divide-isnt-direct-result-corruption.shtml">tends to upset politically powerful telecom monopolies</a>, we usually only pay lip service to that concept as well.

<p>
For years, Comcast has slowly but surely expanded its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160105/08100533246/with-fixed-costs-fat-margins-comcasts-broadband-cap-justifications-are-total-bullshit.shtml">pointless and arbitrary</a> broadband usage caps and overage fees into all of its markets (picture the boiling frog metaphor, with you as the frog). And for most of that time, the company avoided doing so in the Northeast where it faces more competition from competitors like (uncapped) Verizon FiOS. But recently, likely fearing an incoming Biden FCC willing to do its job, Comcast rushed to finally push these useless, confusing, and expensive restrictions <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201123/07280445757/comcast-expands-bullshit-usage-capsin-middle-pandemic.shtml">into the Northeast</a>. In the middle of a pandemic. When people were already struggling to pay for basic utilities and rent.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, lawmakers weren't happy about it. Massachusetts lawmakers were quick to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210104/07362445991/lawmakers-complain-about-comcasts-bullshit-expanded-usage-caps.shtml">complain about the practice</a>, noting that price gouging captive customers during a financial and health crisis isn't a good look. This morning, Pennsylvania AG nabbed headlines after Comcast announced it would be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/03/comcast-suspends-data-caps/">pausing the expansion of usage caps for a few months</a> (until July):
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The Philadelphia-based cable giant said it would postpone the new charges after Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) raised concerns that Comcast’s policy threatened to disproportionately harm cash-strapped Americans who are learning, working and communicating primarily online."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
There are a couple problems here. One, The Washington Post (like a lot of outlets) never even informs readers that the caps are technically unnecessary. They're literally the monopolistic price gouging of captive customers using technically unnecessary nonsense. That's kind of important context, without which the reader walks away possibly thinking Comcast is somehow being altruistic here. This is pretty standard practice for a mainstream US tech press which has a violent allergic reaction to calling a duck a duck (in this case, monopolistic price gouging).
</p>
<p>
Two, I know from my <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzm5j/new-massachusetts-bill-would-ban-broadband-caps-during-the-pandemic">conversations with Massachusetts lawmakers last week</a> that briefly suspending the caps for a few months was Comcast's idea. It was their base offer in negotiations, and they're unwilling to go further. As such, what's portrayed here as a savvy win for PA AG Josh Shapiro is really just him agreeing to let Comcast get away with doing what is effectively nothing. These restrictions shouldn't exist in the first place. Suspending them for just a few months in one portion of the country is an empty gesture. Comcast will simply bring them back once the PR heat dies down a bit.
</p>
<p>
If there's an area the modern FCC and state regulators have failed miserably, under both parties, it's broadband caps. It shouldn't take a pandemic to realize that monopolies imposing costly, confusing, and unnecessary restrictions to drive up the already high cost of broadband access isn't a great idea (such restrictions are also <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200602/09403644628/net-neutrali-what-atts-new-streaming-service-wont-count-against-broadband-caps-netflix-will.shtml">also abused competitively in the streaming space</a>). And, with only the occasional exception, and despite endless, breathless yammering on about the "digital divide," most federal and state regulators clearly couldn't give any less of a shit.

<p>
You'd hardly know there was an historic economic and health crisis going on based on Comcast's behavior.
</p>
<p>
Clearly nervous about a new incoming regulatory regime that even <em>semi-coherently</em> focuses on consumer issues, Comcast last month <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201123/07280445757/comcast-expands-bullshit-usage-capsin-middle-pandemic.shtml">expanded its bullshit usage caps into the Northeast</a>, one of the only regions that had yet to be saddled with the charges. The monthly cap and resulting overage fees, which you can avoid by paying for an "unlimited" plan, serves no technical or financial purpose. The restrictions <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160105/08100533246/with-fixed-costs-fat-margins-comcasts-broadband-cap-justifications-are-total-bullshit.shtml">don't actually help manage network congestion</a>, flat-rate broadband is already hugely profitable due to muted competition, and ISPs like Comcast can deal with a small minority of extra-heavy bandwidth users by <em>pushing them to a business-class tier of service</em>. It's literally just a cash grab on the backs of uncompetitive US broadband markets.
</p>
<p>
But Comcast's not stopping there. The company also recently imposed a price increase on its <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/comcast-to-raise-prices-in-new-year/">cable TV bundles, broadband service</a>, and many of the bullshit fees it imposes on your bill to help it falsely advertise a lower rate. This includes the company's "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181127/06451541108/150-to-10-per-month-how-comcasts-bogus-fees-are-false-advertising.shtml">Broadcast TV fee</a>," which is literally just a portion of your existing cable TV bill, broken out and hidden below the line, leaving you uncertain of <em>what you'll actually be paying for service</em> until you've received a few bills. It's false advertising and predatory, but good luck finding a US regulator or lawmaker who much cares.
</p>
<p>
But Comcast's not even stopping there; the company also says it's going to start <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/24/business/comcast-will-charge-more-house-calls/">charging significantly more for house calls</a> in the new year:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The giant cable company, which serves 1.9 million users in Greater Boston, New Hampshire and Maine, will charge $100 to install cable service, effective Jan. 1. That’s up from a current price of $79. In addition, Comcast will charge $70 for in-house service calls, up from $40."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Again, this is just monopolistic price gouging of captive markets. Only made possible due to two things: a lack of competition in many markets, and utterly corrupt and feckless lawmakers and regulators. Folks in positions of "leadership" who have no problem with the fact the cable industry makes around <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191008/08474843146/cable-industry-makes-28-billion-annually-bullshit-fees.shtml">$28 billion every single year</a> simply on bullshit fees alone. That was <em>always a problem</em>, but it's a particularly pointed issue now that COVID has revealed how essential affordable broadband is for little things like, oh, survival.
</p>
<p>
And yet, US regulators and lawmakers who've spent the better part of the last two years hyperventilating about "big tech," have not only <em>ignored the problem</em>, they've happily gutted most oversight of natural monopolies like Comcast. The same Comcast whose broadband monopoly is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180314/09251639423/cable-industry-is-quietly-securing-massive-monopoly-over-american-broadband.shtml">only growing</a> as traditional phone companies effectively give up on traditional, fixed residential broadband service.

<h3>from the <i>broken-industries</i> dept</h3><div class="byline"><span class="pub_date">Tue, Dec 22nd 2020 6:41am</span> &mdash;
<a href="/user/kbode">Karl Bode</a></div>
<p>
For much of the last few years, broadband customers have been complaining that Frontier Communications, the nation's third-biggest telco, had been charging its customers a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/frontier-customer-bought-his-own-router-but-has-to-pay-10-rental-fee-anyway/">rental fee for modems they already owned</a>. Normally, you're supposed to be able to buy your own modem instead of paying your ISP a rental fee upwards of $10 per month. To nab some extra dough from captive customers, Frontier basically decided to charge its customers a rental fee anyway, giving them a polite, though giant, middle finger when they complained.
</p>
<p>
This fa&ccedil;ade persisted until customers had a problem with their hardware, at which point the ISP would just shrug and claim there was nothing they could do. When consumers complained to the Trump FCC about this, the agency did... absolutely nothing. As with most complaints to the Trump FCC, the agency just forwards your complaint to the ISP in question then does... nothing whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
This kind of behavior is the norm for the broadband industry, given it faces minimal pressure to try harder due to limited competition and captured regulators. So consumer advocates last year successfully pushed for the passage of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/01/us-finally-prohibits-isps-from-charging-for-routers-they-dont-provide/">Television Viewer Protection Act</a> (TVPA). The law, which likely would have never made it past a broken and corrupt Congress in standalone form, had to be shoveled into a budget bill in order to be passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in December 2019. It's not likely that many, including Trump, even noticed that the provision existed in the broader bill.
</p>
<p>
The bill prohibits charging consumers a rental fee for hardware they already own. It also requires that ISPs be a bit more transparent about all the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191008/08474843146/cable-industry-makes-28-billion-annually-bullshit-fees.shtml">bullshit fees</a> broadband providers use to pad their advertised rates. And it gives you a 24 hours to cancel cable TV for any reason. It's not perfect; the bill doesn't prohibit ISPs from using bogus fees to raise your rate while under contract. It's also loosely worded enough that ISPs could likely find some new ways to tap dance around it. But it's still a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/law-banning-rental-fees-for-customer-owned-routers-takes-effect-sunday/">step in the right direction</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"For years, consumers have been misled by pay-TV providers advertising service for one price and then charging another," Public Knowledge Senior VP Harold Feld said in a press release today. "Until now, consumers have had zero recourse for dealing with these surprise fees other than ending service and paying an unfair termination fee for the privilege. Not anymore."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Granted, <em>even after the bill was passed</em>, the FCC <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200604/09392344642/fcc-delays-law-banning-your-isp-charging-you-rental-fees-hardware-you-already-own.shtml">delayed implementing it for six months</a>, arguing that <b>not ripping consumers off</b> was too onerous of a requirement to place on a regional telecom monopoly during a pandemic. Keep in mind Frontier is a bankrupt mess with a long history of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200401/07492544210/want-to-know-why-us-broadband-is-bad-joke-take-close-look-frontier-communications.shtml">dodgy behavior and fraud</a>. And, more often than not, the FCC's reaction (basically: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) is pretty much the norm. Especially during the Trump FCC, which is so disinterested in consumer protection, it effectively <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190611/13180142374/heres-why-net-neutrality-still-matters-one-year-after-repeal.shtml">lobotomized its authority</a> just because Comcast and AT&#038;T <em>asked it to</em>.
</p>
<p>
The cable industry alone makes a whopping <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191008/08474843146/cable-industry-makes-28-billion-annually-bullshit-fees.shtml">$28 billion annually in bullshit fees</a>. They've been doing this sort of thing for decades and, aside from the occasional noise, the U.S. government simply couldn't give any less of a shit. And of course it's not just telecom. Countless heavily monopolized sectors (banking, airlines) engage in the same behavior, and those in a position to do something about it <em>simply couldn't care less</em>. There's almost an understated American belief that tricking users into paying more via bogus fees is <em>just creative pricing</em> and it's the consumer's fault for being ripped off.
</p>
<p>
So here we are. Having to sneakily pass a new law to stop monopolies from charging you <em>even more money</em> for things you already own. Now we have to wait to see if anybody can be bothered to actually enforce it.

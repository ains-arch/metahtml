U.S. authorities now believe that additional initial access vectors other than the SolarWinds platform exist, but these are still being investigated. The US Cybersecurity &amp; Information Security Agency (CISA) expects that removing this threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging.</p><p>One of the major techniques used by the threat actor as part of the SolarWinds attack, was compromising the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) signing certificate, using their Active Directory privileges. CISA explained that âonce this is accomplished, the adversary creates unauthorized but valid tokens and presents them to services that trust SAML tokens from the environment. These tokens can then be used to access resources in hosted environments, such as email, for data exfiltration via authorized application programming interfaces (APIs)â[1].</p><p>The âGolden SAMLâ attack technique enables attackers to forge SAML responses and bypass ADFS authentication to access federated services. First reported by CyberArk in 2017, the current attack is the first time that this technique is known to have been used âin the wildâ.</p><p>To successfully leverage Golden SAML, an attacker must first gain administrative access to the ADFS server and extract the necessary certificate and private key. Once this is accomplished, unauthorized access can be performed from anywhere, without further access to the victim environment. </p><p>Unless discovered and remediated, this attack provides attackers with persistent access to all services federated with ADFS. Such services often include critical infrastructure and sensitive data such as AWS and Office 365. Accounting for some of the key functions and systems that commonly use SAML, CISA referred to hosted email services, hosted business intelligence applications, travel systems, timecard systems, and file storage services (such as SharePoint).</p><p>The recent rise in awareness and novel in-the-wild use of this attack significantly raises the likelihood of attackers leveraging it to their advantage. It is therefore highly advised that organizations move swiftly in taking the necessary steps to protect their SSO infrastructure and establish effective monitoring to detect and respond to such attacks.</p><h4>Golden SAMLÂ Attack<br/></h4><p>In order to explain the Golden SAML attack, weâll first provide a short description of the legitimate SAML authentication process. The process involves the following steps, illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>:</p><p><strong>1.Â  </strong>User attempts to access desired service (e.g. AWS, Office 365).</p><p><strong>2.Â Â </strong>Service redirects user to ADFS for authentication.</p><p><strong>3.Â Â </strong>User authenticates with ADFS according to Domain policy (e.g. Multi-Factor-Authentication).</p><p><strong>4.Â Â </strong>ADFS returns signed SAML response to user machine.</p><p><strong>5.Â Â </strong>User presents desired service with signed SAML response and receives access.</p><figure style="max-width:1242px" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/594bb4be5d975d31da8bea55/5fdefe8de074c031d7fba3fc_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-20%20at%209.34.08.png" loading="lazy" width="642" alt=""/></div><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: </strong>Legitimate SAML Authentication Process</figcaption></figure><p>When performing a golden SAML attack, an adversary must first gain administrative privileges on the ADFS server through additional Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation.

Critical data and infrastructure can now be compromised without any additional access to the victim environment. This powerful access will persist until the existing ADFS private key is invalidated and replaced, a difficult process requiring altering or terminating connectivity to all federated systems and re-creating them. </p><p>The increasingly rapid transition of critical assets to cloud services is making ADFS SAML and other SSO infrastructures lucrative high value targets for threat actors. The current hype and increased attention may lead to a rise of Golden SAML attacks. Along with the difficulty of remediating such attacks and the persistent access afforded to a successful attacker, we expect this technique to present a major challenge for defenders, SOCs and security teams.</p><p>â</p><h4>Detecting and Hunting Golden SAML Attack</h4><p>Based on understanding the attack process and modeling the attack in several environments, we recommend the following analyses to detect a Golden SAML attack. While there are many potential detection mechanisms which are only applicable when attackers erroneously leave unnecessary traces, our focus in this section will be on analyses capable of detecting any standard Golden SAML attack.</p><p>The analyses proposed here are designed for a standard Golden SAML attack, targeting an on-prem ADFS architecture. Other variations of SAML attacks, such as those targeting Azure AD, may require additional detection analyses.</p><p><strong>Detection Method 1 - Correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in ADFS and Domain Controllers</strong></p><p>When performing legitimate authentication to an on-prem ADFS, the following events are logged:</p><p>In the ADFS server Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li>Event id 1202 â âThe Federation Service validated a new credentialâ.</li><li>Event id 1200 â &quot;The Federation Service issued a valid tokenâ.</li></ul><p>In the Domain Controller Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li>Â Event id 4769 â âA Kerberos service ticket was requestedâ, the source IP being the ADFS.</li></ul><p>Â Â In the service provider logs:</p><ul role="list"><li>Appropriate log for each service, indicating a successful login (e.g. âConsoleLoginâ or âAssumeRoleWithSAMLâ in AWS or &#x27;Sign-ins&#x27; in Azure AD).</li></ul><p>However, when authenticating with a Golden SAML forged response the only event logged is the login to the service provider. The ADFS and Domain Controller are not involved in the authentication process in this scenario, and therefore do not log any events. While an attacker may also create a TGS request leaving behind a Kerberos requests (Event id 4769) on the Domain Controller, they cannot successfully authenticate to ADFS and create the standard authentication events.</p><p>Therefore, in order to detect Golden SAML authentications we can simply search for any logins to service providers using SAML SSO, which do not have corresponding 4769, 1200 and 1202 events in the Domain.</p><p>This detection mechanism is powerful, as it strikes at the core difference between a legitimate SAML authentication and a Golden SAML attack.</p><p>In order to facilitate this analysis, ensure the above mentioned events are enabled in audit policy:</p><ul role="list"><li>Audit ObjectAccess: success and failure on ADFS for event ids 1200 and 1202.</li><li>AccountLogon - Kerberos Service Ticket Operations: success and failure on the Domain Controllers for event id 4769.</li><li>Applicable login audit logs from service provider.</li></ul><p>â<strong>Detection Method 2 â Identifying certificate export events in ADFS</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, a Golden SAML attack requires the private key and certificate of the ADFS. Access to these can be obtained by exporting the certificate from the ADFS server, generating event id 1007 (enabled by default) in the âMicrosoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-Systemâ Windows Event Log.</p><p>Additionally, command-line evidence for exporting the ADFS certificate is likely incriminating. In many cases these can be found in:</p><ul role="list"><li>PowerShell script block logs: &#x27;Export-PfxCertificate&#x27; or &#x27;certutil -exportPFX&#x27; in event ids 4103 and 4104.</li><li>Command line auditing tools (e.g. event id 4688): using certutil.exe -exportPFX.</li><li>Execution evidence of known tools such as Mimikatz and ADFSDump. Certificate extraction with ADFSdump can be detected using Sysmon Event id 18, when the pipe name is â\microsoft##wid\tsql\queryâ, excluding processes regularly making this pipe connection on the machine.</li></ul><p><strong>Detection Method 3 â Customizing SAMLÂ response to identify irregular access</strong></p><p>In order to facilitate an additional layer of monitoring, organizations can modify their SAML responses to include custom elements for each service provider. Once enabled, these custom elements can be monitored in service provider access logs to detect any anomalous requests. While these parameters can be faked by an attacker, theyâre likely to be different and facilitate effective detection of Golden SAML attacks.</p><p><strong>Detection Method 4 â Detecting malicious ADFS trust modification</strong></p><p>An attacker gaining administrative access to ADFS may, instead of extracting the certificate and private key for a standard Golden SAML attack, add a new trusted ADFS. This approach will enable them to sign valid SAML responses and gain persistent access to resources, while evading detection by methods 1-3 . This attack can be detected by monitoring the creation of new ADFS trust, using these events in the ADFS server Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li>Event id 307 â âThe Federation Service configuration was changedâ. This event can be correlated to relevant event 510 with the same Instance ID for change details.</li><li>Event id 510 with the same Instance ID â could be more than one event per single 307 event. These events should be reviewed, specifically searching for âConfiguration: Type: IssuanceAuthorityâ where âProperty Valueâ references an unfamiliar Domain.</li></ul><p>â</p><p>â</p><p>â</p><p>â</p><p>[1] CISA Alert (AA20-352A)Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-2 mata-bg hidden wf-section"><div class="container-5 w-container"><div class="h1-holder"><h1 class="h1 hpph ap bp">Praying Mantis: An Advanced Memory-Resident Attack<br/></h1><div class="ibp-line-container-new-2"><div class="ibp-libe-heavy"></div><div class="inp-header-long-line"></div></div></div><p class="p ap">Sygnia deploys top talent and implements the operational art of elite military units, digital combat experience, and a deep understanding of attackers to secure organizations.</p><p class="p ap-author">July 2021<em><br/></em></p><div class="inner-page-rich-text w-richtext"><p><strong>While responding to targeted attacks on high-profile organizations in the United States, Sygnia researchers investigated an advanced memory-resident attack commonly associated with nation-state actors.</strong></p><h4>Key Points</h4><ul role="list"><li>The Sygnia Incident Response team identified an advanced and persistent threat actor, operating almost completely in-memory.

The attacks targeted prominent organizations in the U.S. and exploited internet-facing servers to infiltrate their networks.</p><p><strong>An advanced, stealthy threat actor</strong></p><p>The attack Sygnia identified and responded to was carried out by an advanced and persistent threat actor dubbed &quot;Praying Mantis&quot;, which operates almost completely in-memory.</p><p>The initial foothold within the network was obtained by leveraging a variety of deserialization exploits targeting Windows IIS servers and vulnerabilities targeting web applications. The activities observed suggest that Praying Mantis is highly familiar with the Windows IIS software and equipped with zero-day exploits.</p><p>Praying Mantis utilizes a completely volatile and custom malware framework tailor-made for IIS servers. The core component loaded on to internet-facing IIS servers, intercepts and handles any HTTP request received by the server. The threat actor also uses an additional stealthy backdoor and several post-exploitations modules to perform network reconnaissance, elevate privileges, and move laterally within networks.</p><p>The nature of the attack and general modus operandi of the activities suggest that Praying Mantis is an experienced stealthy actor highly aware of OPSEC (operations security). The malware used shows a significant effort to avoid detection by actively interfering with logging mechanisms, successfully evading commercial EDRs, as well as silently awaiting incoming connections rather than connecting back to a C2 channel and continuously generating traffic. Furthermore, Praying Mantis actively removed all disk-resident tools after using the â effectively sacrificing persistency for stealth.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/594bb4be5d975d31da8bea55/60feeb1febfe90579f0a265c_image002.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div><figcaption>Praying Mantis&#x27; Toolset Infrastructure</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Have we seen this before?</strong></p><p>The threat actorâs tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) strongly correlate with the ones described in an advisory published by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) in June 2020.

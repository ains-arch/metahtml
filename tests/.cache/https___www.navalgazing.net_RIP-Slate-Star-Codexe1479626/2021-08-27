<p>Today is a sad day.  This blog started in the comments of Slate Star Codex.  Its author, a psychiatrist named Scott Alexander, <a class='urllink' href='https://slatestarcodex.com/' rel='nofollow'>has just shut it down because the NYT was threatening to dox him.</a>  Most of you probably already know this, but some of you came from elsewhere on the internet, and I also wanted to show support to Scott in this.  I've contacted the NYT and expressed my displeasure, and I'd encourage you to do the same.  
</p>
<p>I was actually one of the people who the reporter contacted, and I agreed to speak to him.  But I asked that he not use my real name, because it makes it easier to speak on certain topics here.  He readily agreed, but wasn't willing to extend the same courtesy to Scott, who has far better reason to keep his real and internet lives separate.  Shame on them.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>There's also <a class='urllink' href='https://www.dontdoxscottalexander.com' rel='nofollow'>a petition/open letter</a> on the subject, for those who want to sign.
</p>
<p>Said Achmiz, who handles the technical side of Naval Gazing, has set up a forum for the SSC diaspora, <a class='urllink' href='https://datasecretslox.obormot.net/' rel='nofollow'>Data Secrets Lox</a>.  I'd recommend anyone who misses the community to go and check it out.

<span class='commenttext'><p>Well damn. I went to SSC this morning to read over breakfast and was not all that surprised when it didn't load. To Scott and everyone from the commentariat, I love you all and miss you. You were the smartest, friendliest and most kind and thoughtful group of people I've met and I will miss you dearly. Shame on the New York Times.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>This was inevitable, and I've been dreading it for a couple of years now, but I was hoping we'd have at least another few good years.  And maybe we can port the best parts of the community over to a new home, but I'm not terribly optimistic on that front. I'm going to miss Scott, and all of my friends, a lot.</p>

<p>Slate Star Codex was our last, best hope for peace on the internet.  It failed.  </p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>I seldom commented but I followed the OT obsessively, even though some of the political discussions were too US-centric for my tastes. Although most posters cannot be reached now (obviously) what do you think of the possibility of recreating some of the community from the people who (like me) wandered into your blog to try to get in touch with ssc posters? Welldotdotdot also has a (seldom updated) blog, DFriedman and family can be contacted, as well as NancyL and (probably) the reasonable SJW guy who started posting a few weeks ago (he left is email there)  Feel free to not let this post through, in case you fear turning the Eye of Sauron onto you</p>

It's not like journalism is unfamiliar with the idea of protecting someone's anonymity.<br />
Contacting the nyt or Metz and asking them to reconsider may be helpful.  </p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>If we do try to regroup somewhere else, it might be best to be a bit less secretive right from the start. It's hard to mix anonymity and any sort of success, since success begets fame, and the more famous you get, the more people will be motivated to find out who you really are. Requiring at least the mods to be operating under their own names might be for the best. </p>

<p>It's not like you need to be anonymous to run a forum. John Scalzi, Charles Stross, and the Nielsen Haydens have all hosted active discussion sites for years, openly.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>Presumably, the SSC subreddit is where the community will go. </p>

<p>Interesting to know that he gave you the courtesy of anonymity. You work in defense, right? Did he know that, and give you anonymity because of it? (I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when I can, and that's the only not-flagrantly-terrible reason I can think of to do so.) What kind of questions did he ask? </p>

<p>I'm kind of pissed off, tbh. </p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>@Johan</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's necessary.  Scott was secretive for good reason, and if he wasn't, then there's a lot of stuff we wouldn't have gotten.  If my real name was clearly linked to to this blog, there's a couple of posts I'd take down, and a few more that I have long-term plans for that will never get written.  Nothing horrible, but it's a bit close to my real life for comfort.  So all insisting on real names does in this kind of case is destroy potential content.  And a forum is a lot less likely to be a target for this kind of thing in the first place.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>"It’s not like you need to be anonymous to run a forum. John Scalzi, Charles Stross, and the Nielsen Haydens have all hosted active discussion sites for years, openly."</p>

<p>Relevant differences between those four and Scott Alexander are left as an exercise for the reader; I think Scott is correct that he cannot openly host anything like SSC without completely upending his meatspace life.  Are you volunteering to host the new community, and do you think you're up to it?</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>@Alsadius</p>

<p>When he emailed me, I said I was potentially interested in talking, so long as my name didn't appear in the article, because I work in defense and have a defense blog.  He agreed before we spoke.</p>

<p>As for questions, a lot of it was about diversity and readership.  Some about the blog community and meetups, including a few about the times I met Scott.  Nothing on AI or coronavirus.  He also asked for Scott's real name, which I refused to give.  I told him that I'd done some looking and was satisfied that he was who he said he was, but that I wasn't going to help him with that, and that he should contact Scott.  The impression I got was that he was trying to check bona fides.  No clue on the plan to reveal Scott's real name.  I emailed Scott about those questions almost immediately.</p>
</span>

<span class='commenttext'><p>@john</p>

<p>I'd be happy to do it. I already run one of the local DC meetups.  I wouldn't do it under my real name, of course, but doing it under a real name isn't necessary.  What I can't do, though, is get all the people I liked talking to to follow me over, or generate scott essays to attract new people, so what's the point?</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>I suspect that a lot of the OT regulars would gravitate towards a forum or something of that nature which isn't Reddit.  I'd certainly signal-boost any effort as hard as I could, and I suspect we'll get more refugees here as one of the obvious places to look for this kind of thing.</p>

<p>No, I can't run it myself.  I'm buying a house in a week.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>I'm pissed, but I can't say that I'm entirely surprised. My read on this is that this reporter doesn't understand how much Scott is hated by certain parts of the Internet, and to what extent those factions are willing to go to break someone's career and livelihood if they feel that a person is even associating with certain viewpoints that they find abhorrent. </p>

<p>I figured SSC would get taken down eventually. You can only get so many mentions in influential blogs like Vox or Marginal Revolution before the real world takes an interest and starts sniffing around. Given the amount of flak that Scott took for being associated with the SSC subreddit (and the Culture War threads there, more specifically), I'm not surprised he took the blog rather than go through something potentially an order of magnitude worse.</p>

<p>(Hopefully I'm not stepping over the line re: this blog's culture-war policy here)   </p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>The point of my CW policy is that I don't want the war being fought here.  In this case, I'm pretty sure everyone here is on the same side.  Also, I sort of invited it by bringing the topic up.  </p>

<p>And thanks on the house.  I'm definitely looking forward to having more shelf space, as I'm currently completely out.  The rest?  A mixture of trepidation and excitement.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>I wouldn't be interested in hosting such a forum solo; it's too much work. But I'd be willing to serve as one of a partnership of owner/moderators, and to do so under my own name. But as part of setting up such a forum, I would want to have a serious discussion of what topics or viewpoints we are not willing to host on the forum. And the scope of discussion I would argue for is narrower than what Scott allowed.</p>

<p>In my case, there are some topics I consider inherently disgusting, and would want banned from the forum: snuff films or bukkake, for instance. There are others which I recognize as controversial, but would be willing to allow, such as affirmative action and the male-female gender gap. And there are still others which I'd be willing to put up with in principle, but which will probably be more trouble than they're worth, and I would therefore argue for keeping them out: racial IQ differences or the exact size of the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Congrats on the house! When it's yours, at least you can always yell at the landlord to fix stuff.</p>

<p>I suspect this has the potential to be a turning point, or at least the end of the beginning. Will Scott's big name fans come out in force? Will it matter against the eye of sauron? Can any defensive victory actually reduce their power, or will they just turn their evil gaze to more helpless prey?<br />
One way or another, we're finally going to find out how far this goes.</p>

<p>Well, that's just it, isn't it? The reason Slate Star Codex will be missed so much is that Scott Alexander understood that those topics were "more trouble than they were worth" and <em>engaged with them anyway</em>. It was one of the few places on the Internet where you could read a fair minded summary of the "other side", no matter how abhorrent you found it. Moreover, it was a summary that was <em>public</em>, which meant that items on Slate Star Codex could be linked to and discussed more broadly, in a way that private forum posts could not.</p>

<p>It was probably always unsustainable, and as Blackshoe said above, "Sic transit gloria mundi".   </p>

<p>@cassander
If SSC doesn't come back at the end of all of this, please do start a new home! Reddit just doesn't cut it. As for your concerns, first, I think a lot of the regular commenters would make the move if a new home were created. And secondly, the community has already shown itself willing to write long-form posts from time to time (adversarial collaborations, book reviews), so new people might be gained from posts like those. Heck, Scott might even show up after a while under a new name.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>In terms of the future, I think we need to make a distinction between Scott and the SSC community, particularly the OT regulars.

Hence the forum or whatever.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>I am fairly optimistic that this is just a temporary shutdown.</p>

<p>Since this is a military blog, it seems appropriate to applaud Scott for bold and correct strategy in dealing with this. He is a victim of his own success as a blogger; being that high profile and remaining anonymous is simply inherently difficult. Drastic actions like this to establish credible deterrence are thus necessary. Of course it might not work, but in that case, probably nothing would.</p>

<p>I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's a nasty coordination problem to solve.  It's funny, because many years ago I argued for moving the open threads to reddit, only to come to realize how wrong I was. The community needs its own space to keep its character.</p>

<p>@alesziegler</p>

<p>I'm not convinced this was the correct strategy. At the very least, there should have been some strongly worded letters sent to the reporter, his editor, and his editor's boss about how displeased Scott was about the prospect of getting doxed and reminding them that anonymity was part of the initial understanding.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>Re coordinating: Scott has left an email subscription form on the gravestone page. So if someone does put up some forum or anything - and that includes Le Maistre Chat's blog - it seems a good idea to ask Scott to share the link with those who subscribed.</p>

<p>Re the general situation: assuming the reporter complied or Scott were OK with doxxing, how likely is it that the article would actually be nice and positive just because the reporter said so? I.e. how expected is it from NYT to make the published article look completely different from how it was presented to the interviewee? I know media with less of a name do it all the time, but no idea about NYT.</p>

<p>Scott was never very careful about his identity, and attracted a lot of attention with his writing. I'd host it under a pseudonym that has nothing to do with me in any context, not write long think pieces, and not talk a lot about it, especially to reporters. Ideally I'd get a couple other people to run it with me, and in the unlikely event that one of us got found out in a way that was damaging, they would deny everything and the others would back up his story.  That should be enough to muddy the waters.</p>

<span class='commenttext'><p>LMC, I think you were a little too CW trugger-happy... it all depends on who is attempting to out/doxx whom. If FOXNews or Breitbart were the ones who threatened to out Scott, it is obvious that any appeals coming from the left or center would be discounted as " good, this shows we are doing something right" , and that the best strategy would be to have Trumpers, nationalists, even NRx, etc. to plead with them. Since NYT sees itself as (at least) non-libertarian and non-GOP and has a weltanschaueng closer to the progressive or centre-left, it stands to reason that appeals from their ingroup will carry more weight. </p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand. What is the significance of Robert C. Richardson the 4th being the NYT editor?</p>

The tri-service strategy, entitled ‘Advantage at Sea: Prevailing with Integrated All-Domain Naval Power’, proposes several important changes to the way the maritime services have operated in the past. It emphasises the threats to the US posed by China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. It also calls for the use of more assertive ‘day-to-day operations’ to deny adversaries gains they might achieve through incremental steps that do not give rise to a crisis or war. The strategy emphasises the development and use of distributed operations because massed naval forces are increasingly vulnerable to long-range missiles. It also calls for the use of new types of expeditionary operations to deny adversaries access to the sea, for the US to strengthen its international alliances and partnerships, and for investment in new technologies, such as advanced uninhabited platforms, instead of maintaining and adapting older platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\u0022text-align: left;\u0022\u003eThe new strategy is not only an analytical exercise. It should also be interpreted as a bureaucratic effort by the maritime services to present to important audiences in Congress and the White House the argument that their share of future defence spending should be increased, implicitly at the expense of the Army, Air Force and Space Force. The document was released at the very end of one presidential administration and before the beginning of another. President Joe Biden and his team at the Department of Defense were therefore not consulted in the process, but they will play the most important roles in deciding the future of the US maritime strategy – at least until 2024 or 2028, and within the bounds established by Congress – particularly because the drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan means that the primary operational roles for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard will no longer be to support land wars in Asia but to focus on the Indo-Pacific maritime theatre.\u003c/p\u003e","className":"richtext reading--content font-secondary"}), document.getElementById("react_f0fnrR3oV0KTSGyPSQ2BQ"))});</script><div id="react_hClpshr3S0qLRaGuZWg4wA"></div>

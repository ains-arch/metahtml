<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Back in 2009, the FCC funded a Harvard study <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/stage/pdf/Berkman_Center_Broadband_Study_13Oct09.pdf">that concluded</a> (pdf) that open access broadband networks (letting multiple ISPs come in and compete over a central, core network) resulted in lower broadband prices and better service in numerous locations worldwide. Of course when the Obama FCC released its "National Broadband Plan" back in 2010, this realization (not to mention an honest accounting of the sector's limited competition) was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150628/13060131486/google-fiber-has-accomplished-more-broadband-than-our-national-broadband-plan-ever-did.shtml">nowhere to be found</a>. Both parties ignored the data and instead doubled down on our existing national telecom policy plan: letting AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast do pretty much whatever they'd like. Something, of course, taken to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181022/07183740886/ajit-pai-telecom-lobbyists-are-now-coordinating-their-lies-perfect-symmetry.shtml">ridiculous new heights during the Trump era</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, "open access" has become somewhat of a dirty word in telecom policy, and even companies like Google Fiber -- which originally promised to adhere to the concept on its own network before quietly backpedaling -- are eager to pretend the idea doesn't exist. Why? Because having ISPs compete in layers over a centralized network may improve service, boost speeds, and reduce prices (see: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191021/11053843231/this-idaho-town-lets-you-switch-between-cheap-fiber-isps-matter-seconds.shtml">this community-run network in Ammon, Idaho</a>), but it would eat into the revenues of the regional monopolies <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150815/15220831968/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner.shtml">bone-grafted to our intelligence gathering apparatus</a>, and you simply can't have that.
</p>
<p>
Which is why it was surprising to see California recently pass a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/california-passes-historic-plan-for-statewide-open-access-fiber-network/">$6 billion broadband infrastructure bill that does something unique</a>: it mandates the creation of a massive "middle mile" fiber network that will be open access, which should encourage increased competition. The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/governor-newsom-legislative-leaders-announce-historic-broadband-budget-bill/">original announcement</a> breaks down the spending this way:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
<li>$3.25 billion to build, operate and maintain an open access, state-owned middle mile network – high-capacity fiber lines that carry large amounts of data at higher speeds over longer distances between local networks.</li><li>$2 billion to set up last-mile broadband connections that will connect homes and businesses with local networks. The legislation expedites project deployment and enables Tribes and local governments to access this funding.</li><li>$750 million for a loan loss reserve fund to bolster the ability of local governments and nonprofits to secure financing for broadband infrastructure.</li>
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
That's a lot of money that could be potentially going somewhere <b>other</b> than entrenched telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast. That means increased competition, something AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and others fight tooth and nail (rather successfully) to avoid. You can tell AT&T in particular is nervous about it, because the new bill's passage forced the company to <a href="https://californiansforbroadbandequity.com/">recently launch this silly astroturf website</a> claiming to represent "Californians for broadband equity." The website is chock full of stock photos of children, and lots of empty lip service to "fixing the digital divide":
</p>
<div class="centered"><a href="https://imgur.com/yiuyCpJ"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yiuyCpJ.png" title="source: imgur.com" width="550" /></a></div>
<p>
Only if you look at some of the materials posted in the page's <a href="https://californiansforbroadbandequity.com/resources/">resources</a> section do you see the site is backed by AT&T and Frontier Communications.
</p>
<p>
To be very clear, dominant regional monopolies in California like AT&T and Frontier <b>love</b> the decades-old US telecom policy approach to broadband. Namely, throw billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies at incumbent monopolies, which then <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140620/17592427642/everytime-att-wants-federal-approval-merger-policy-it-promises-its-necessary-to-deliver-100-broadband-then-doesnt-deliver.shtml">fail to deliver what was promised</a>, refuse to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171016/14224738415/after-report-suggests-it-ripped-off-taxpayers-frontier-communications-shrugs-when-asked-subsidies-back.shtml">give back the money</a>, and then pretend they're not part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
There's an entire universe of AT&T-linked orgs and individuals that suffer <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/fact-checking-yet-another-misleading-mistake-riddled-report-taxpayers-protection-alliance">an absolute embolism</a> anytime taxpayer resources are used to build <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/fact-checking-yet-another-misleading-mistake-riddled-report-taxpayers-protection-alliance">local community broadband efforts</a>. But those same groups and individuals are nowhere to be found every time AT&T gets a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200616/14541444731/att-has-now-eliminated-41000-jobs-since-42-billion-trump-tax-cut.shtml">$42 billion tax cut for doing absolutely nothing</a>. Or gets billions in subsidies and regulatory favors in exchange for fiber networks that are always, mysteriously, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201005/06582445442/mississippi-says-att-took-283-million-network-it-never-fully-deployed.shtml">half deployed</a>.
</p>
<p>
In short, AT&T and Frontier want the focus to remain exclusively on giving <b>them</b> yet more money to shore up access in areas they've neglected for years. What they <b>don't</b> want is any money going toward competition <em>within their existing footprint</em>. Despite the fact that high prices due to limited competition are one of the highest barriers to access for many communities (something <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/03/34-of-lower-income-home-broadband-users-have-had-trouble-paying-for-their-service-amid-covid-19/">particularly pronounced during COVID</a>). US broadband is expensive and mediocre thanks to regional monopolization and the state/federal corruption that protects it. There's a lot of time and money spent trying to ignore or deny that fact.
</p>
<p>
If you didn't understand this context you might stumble into this new AT&T website thinking it's a well intentioned group just <em>super interested</em> in helping poor toddlers get broadband. But it's really just incumbent monopolies trying to ensure more of California's new broadband budget goes to <em>them</em>, and less goes to pesky competitors that might force them to (gasp) compete on price. Should AT&T and Comcast not get their adequate slice of California's planned broadband budget, you can expect a lot more lobbying and policy theatrics of this sort in the fall.

<h3>from the <i>more-of-the-same</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Back around 2007 or so there was a bit of a ruckus when broadband ISPs were found to be selling your "clickstream" data (which sites you visit and how long you're there) to any nitwit with a nickel, then basically <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070410/140020.shtml">denying they were even doing that</a>. Concerns about that now seem quaint.
</p>
<p>
In the years since, technologies like deep packet inspection have allowed ISPs to collect and sell details on every aspect of your online life, then, through obfuscation, proxies, and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190723/08540542637/once-more-with-feeling-anonymized-data-is-not-really-anonymous.shtml">empty promises</a> of "anonymization," insist they're <em>not doing exactly that</em>. Or, as the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191219/07181043599/ny-times-shows-scope-cell-location-data-scandal-nobodys-doing-anything-about.shtml">wireless industry's location data scandals have shown</a>, collect and sell your daily movement habits, initially with only a fleeting concern about user privacy and security.
</p>
<p>
Now, sources in the infosec community <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg84yy/data-brokers-netflow-data-team-cymru">tell Motherboard</a> ISPs are also (again, via proxies) selling access to "netflow data." As the name suggests, netflow data details the day to day <a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1071384086685/isps-privacy-Jul2016.pdf">broader stroke network traffic</a> (pdf), whether that's overall network loads, which servers are talking to one another, network topology, etc. The data is generally beneficial to researchers to understand network and user behavior, and to security experts to help mitigate network attacks. But it's also valuable, and increasingly, it's being offloaded to businesses who are then turning around and selling it:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"I'm concerned that netflow data being offered for commercial purposes is a path to a dark fucking place," one source familiar with the data told Motherboard. Motherboard granted multiple sources anonymity to speak more candidly about industry issues."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Recall that modest FCC broadband privacy rules designed to give users a little more transparency into this stuff were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170328/09565737026/consumer-broadband-privacy-protections-are-dead.shtml">killed by the GOP in 2017</a> (using the Congressional Review Act at telecom industry behest) before they could even take effect. And recall that, thanks to a cross-industry coalition of lobbyists, the United States still doesn't have even a basic privacy law for the internet era. As a result, any shred of data that can be collected and sold is, securing that data is often an afterthought, and consumers more often than not have absolutely no transparency into anything.
</p>
<p>
The data provides comprehensive insight into not just what's happening on the originating ISPs network, but <em>everybody's network</em>, including what data is being pushed through VPNs. ISPs offload this data to security vendors in exchange for security threat analysis work. Those vendors then turn around and act as data brokers, selling access to this data to a wide variety of third parties... without consumer awareness or consent. ISPs then can tell reporters "we don't sell access to user data" because, technically, they aren't directly "selling" it:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The continued sale of sensitive data could present its own privacy and security concerns, and the news highlights that ISPs are providing this data at scale to third parties likely without the informed consent of their own users.
</p>
<p>
"The users almost certainly don't [know]" their data is being provided to Team Cymru, who then sells access to it, the source familiar with the data said.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Again, there's always a lot of hand-wringing about the potential impossibility of privacy legislation given the potential for harm. But it remains entirely possible to craft comprehensive, basic federal rules that, at the very least, mandate absolute transparency with the end user. Instead of doing what we've created with a wild west like ecosystem of app makers, phone makers, software giants, telecoms and others selling every shred of data they can find, often failing to adequately secure it, and with consumer protection (or even awareness) a distant, belated afterthought.

<h1><a href="/articles/20210823/08154347415/cables-us-broadband-monopoly-continues-to-grow.shtml">Cable&#39;s US Broadband Monopoly Continues To Grow</a></h1>
<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
We've noted a few times how US regulators often simply refuse to acknowledge that the US broadband sector is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210525/08350146867/experts-fear-biden-broadband-plan-wont-fix-real-problem-monopolization.shtml">heavily monopolized</a>. Regional cable and phone monopolies are the <em>number one reason</em> US broadband is patchy, expensive, and slow with routinely terrible customer service. But when you see folks in <b>both</b> parties discuss US broadband, industry dysfunction is always framed in this extremely nebulous way (we must "fix the digital divide!"). Largely because nobody in government wants to offend deep-pocketed campaign contributors also <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150815/15220831968/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner.shtml">bone grafted to our domestic surveillance apparatus</a>.
</p>
<p>
The latest <a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/about-890000-added-broadband-in-2q-2021/">broadband data from Leichtman Research</a> illustrates the scope of the problem. The firm notes that the broadband industry added 890,000 subscribers last quarter. Cable companies added 840,000 of that total, while phone companies added just 50,000:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The top cable companies added about 840,000 subscribers in 2Q 2021 – 60% of the net additions for the top cable companies in 2Q 2020. The top wireline phone companies added about 50,000 total broadband subscribers in 2Q 2021 – compared to a net loss of about 140,000 subscribers in 2Q 2020."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Phone companies (Windstream, AT&#038;T, Verizon, Frontier, Centurylink) have effectively given up on residential broadband across much of the country. In many areas that means not just <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190604/11052642330/us-telcos-are-giving-up-residential-broadband-nobody-seems-to-have-noticed.shtml">refusing to upgrade aging DSL lines</a>, but often <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190604/11052642330/us-telcos-are-giving-up-residential-broadband-nobody-seems-to-have-noticed.shtml">refusing to repair them</a>. That's effectively creating a bigger broadband monopoly than ever for entrenched cable giants (usually Charter (Spectrum) and Comcast), which now dominate roughly 70 percent of the fixed line broadband market. No competition means no incentive to expand, compete on price, or shore up terrible customer service.
</p>
<p>
People like to pretend that stuff like satellite broadband and wireless will come in and disrupt this busted paradigm, but that's simply not true. Satellite broadband ventures like Elon Musk's Starlink lack the capacity to truly break this logjam <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210630/08384847095/even-elon-musk-makes-it-clear-starlink-could-have-limited-impact-may-not-be-financially-viable.shtml">at any real scale</a>. And while 5G is also bandied about as a miracle solution to the problem, US wireless isn't a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/why-fiber-vastly-superior-cable-and-5g">real substitute for for traditional fiber</a>, usually comes with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/verizon-to-start-throttling-all-smartphone-videos-to-480p-or-720p/">bizarre restrictions and caveats</a>, and is generally expensive (something that will likely get worse thanks to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191021/07263243227/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details.shtml">recent industry consolidation</a>).
</p>
<p>
The way you fix US broadband dysfunction is by targeting the regional fixed-line monopolies enjoyed by AT&#038;T, Verizon, Comcast, and Charter. One way to do that is to drive most subsidies toward smaller private competitors. Another way to do that would be to embrace and support the growing tide of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3np4a/new-municipal-broadband-map">community broadband efforts growing up around the country</a>, whether they be municipal broadband, cooperatives, public/private partnerships, or utility-based.
</p>
<p>
But because AT&#038;T, Comcast and friends are so politically powerful, efforts to do that usually get largely stripped away from any new broadband bills, as we just witnessed with the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210628/07553247074/support-community-broadband-could-be-chopping-block-as-bipartisan-broadband-negotiations-continue.shtml">Biden broadband plan</a> (in fact, community broadband support was the very first casualty). Often these compromises, at the direct behest of monopoly lobbyists, are then framed as "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210729/07465047268/broadband-portion-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-appears-watered-down-still-helpful.shtml">bipartisan compromise</a>." But because the proposals aren't tackling the <b>real</b> reasons for US broadband dysfunction (regional monopolization and the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170619/09164837615/frontier-communications-caught-again-ripping-off-west-virginia-taxpayers.shtml">state</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181022/07183740886/ajit-pai-telecom-lobbyists-are-now-coordinating-their-lies-perfect-symmetry.shtml">federal</a> corruption that protects it), nothing <em>truly</em> changes.

To be clear, there's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210322/08522246465/yet-more-studies-show-that-5g-isnt-hurting-you.shtml">absolutely no evidence</a> that 5G wireless technology poses a meaningful impact to human health.

That doesn't mean that you don't want to continue studying cellular technology's impact on the human body, or adjust your safety standards when the scientific evidence warrants.
</p>
<p>
In December of 2019 the Ajit Pai FCC announced it would <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-358968A1.pdf">not be updating its radiofrequency (RF) emission guidelines</a>, which determine "safe" levels of exposure. The decision, Pai said, was based on a comprehensive six year review of the available evidence.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, about that.
</p>
<p>
Several groups that lean toward the... conspiratorial... had challenged the FCC's decision, forcing a court review. And when the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit actually reviewed the FCC's decision making process, they found that the FCC didn't <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/court-orders-fcc-to-revisit-its-safety-guidelines-for-rf-radiation">really do its due diligence in reviewing the evidence</a>. The court stated in its <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21044272/fcc-5g.pdf">order</a> (pdf) that while there very well might be good evidence to <b>not</b> change the standards, the FCC under Ajit Pai didn't actually provide it:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Last Friday, the court ruled that the FCC’s decision in 2019 that its 1996 radio frequency emission guidelines adequately protect the public was capricious, arbitrary and not evidence based, in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act. The court also found that the analysis provided by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, on which the FCC relied for its decision, was also not evidence based."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Again that's not to say that it wasn't the <em>right call</em> to maintain the same safety standards, just that the FCC didn't <em>actually</em> provide meaningful evidence in making that determination:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"To be clear, we take no position in the scientific debate regarding the health and environmental effects of RF radiation — we merely conclude that the Commission’s cursory analysis of material record evidence was insufficient as a matter of law,” stated the order."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Granted this whole "making a decision without looking at the actual evidence" thing was a bit of a pattern for the Ajit Pai FCC, whether it was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180813/10070540417/court-rejects-ajit-pais-bid-to-reduce-broadband-subsidies-tribal-areas.shtml">its attempts to kill broadband subsidies for tribal lands</a>, its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190924/08000943051/courts-shoot-down-yet-another-fcc-proposal-being-factually-sketchy.shtml">attacks on media consolidation rules</a>, its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190809/14195942751/courts-again-shoot-down-fcc-ignoring-law-making-up-stuff.shtml">rulings on cell tower placements that largely favored industry</a>, or its attempt to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191001/09533043103/court-says-fcc-cant-stop-states-protecting-net-neutrality.shtml">ban states from protecting broadband consumers</a>. In every example Pai's decisions were shot down by the courts after they found they weren't based on much in the way of <em>legally-supportable fact</em>. Pai's disregard for factual reality was also well represented during the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201027/09525945597/fcc-ignores-courts-finalizes-facts-optional-repeal-net-neutrality.shtml">net neutrality repeal</a>.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the FCC's laziness is now directly fueling conspiracy theorists like Robert Kennedy Jr., who will now use the FCC's screw up as broader evidence that there's some vast health conspiracy going on:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The court’s decision exposes the FCC and FDA as captive agencies that have abandoned their duty to protect public health in favor of a single-minded crusade to increase telecom industry profits,'' said Kennedy, in a statement. Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that the FCC is a "captive agency," led and controlled by telecom industry insiders who are not objective about the health effects of RF radiation."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
It's true that the FCC is historically a captured agency (especially under Trump). It's also true that some of the Pai FCC's laziness could be attributed to not wanting to upset the cellular industry. But that doesn't automatically mean that 5G <em>harms human health</em>. That still needs to be proven by <em>actual evidence</em>. But because Pai didn't do his job properly, that's going to all get lost in translation.

<h3>from the <i>not-so-innovative-I-guess</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
To be clear, wireless carrier app stores have always kind of sucked. Verizon's efforts to create its own app store were <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/11/05/verizon-app-store-shut-down/">shut down in 2012</a>, after underwhelming consumers for years. At the time, the narrative was that Verizon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/5/3605618/verizon-apps-store-closing-january-2013">just didn't find it worth the trouble</a> in the face of Google domination and innovation. And while that's still largely true (wireless carriers are utterly unfamiliar with competition and therefore historically <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060721/0310239.shtml">suck at innovation and adaptation</a>), it turns out there was another reason.
</p>
<p>
Namely, that Google was paying Verizon and other major wireless companies a big chunk of money to <b>not</b> compete with the Android marketplace. And they were paying smartphone manufacturers to ship devices without competing app stores installed. Both nuggets were buried in a freshly unredacted copy of Epic's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.165.1.pdf">antitrust complaint</a> (pdf) against Google, first spotted by Jeremy Owens:

<p>
This agreement to start paying wireless carriers 20-25% of app sales was occurring right around the time that Google brass was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100812/17291310611.shtml">visibly starting to wimp out on consumer-centric issues like net neutrality</a>. That involved working closely with Verizon to push the FCC toward flimsy, loophole-filled, "compromise" 2010 net neutrality rules that <em><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100804/17322110501.shtml">excluded wireless entirely</a></em>. Verizon proceeded to then successfully sue the FCC to have those repealed anyway, leading to better rules in 2015 that were also dismantled a few years, later, albeit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191001/09533043103/court-says-fcc-cant-stop-states-protecting-net-neutrality.shtml">thanks to lobbying, not the courtroom</a>.
</p>
<p>
Google's shift from hugely innovative disruptor to entrenched, elbow-swinging turf protector has been a fairly ugly and historically unsurprising transition. You can clearly see the line in the sand somewhere around 2010 to throw away many of the guiding principles that made them successful and popular. There was another executive leadership pivot sometime around 2016 that brought with it increased timidity at the company (see: the company's abrupt decision to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210126/07195746119/with-loon-dead-google-fiber-frozen-googles-broadband-disruption-plays-arent-looking-so-hot.shtml">largely give up on expanding Google Fiber</a> and many other exciting moonshot projects). Then, more recently there's the whole <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research/google-fires-second-ai-ethics-leader-as-dispute-over-research-diversity-grows-idUSKBN2AJ2JA">AI ethics scandals</a>, which speaks for itself.
</p>
<p>
To be clear Google still does a lot of interesting and popular stuff, but it's pretty damn clear that the ethics and bravery that guided the company originally were obliterated some time back.
</p>
<p>
I have to think that revelations Google was paying wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers to not compete with it will likely fuel several different antitrust inquiries and court cases. Maybe wireless carriers would have always failed to develop compelling app stores of their own thanks to innate incompetence, but it's harder than ever for that to happen when Google is paying you billions of dollars to <em>not even try</em>. And then, should those competing app stores succeed, paying handset makers not to carry them anyway, even if they happen to become popular.
</p>
<p>
As a little side note, the fact Google has been paying wireless carriers billions of dollars to <b>do nothing</b> kind of puts an additional dent in FCC Commissioner's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210602/09445946912/cnet-amplifies-fccs-carrs-attempt-to-force-big-tech-to-pay-big-telecom-no-reason.shtml">ongoing, dumb claim</a> that "big tech" gets a "free ride" on telecom networks. Getting paid to do nothing is the exact kind of thing AT&#038;T has been pushing for since <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100412/0111098965.shtml">2003 or so</a>. It's the kind of stupid demand that started the net neutrality debate. Whether the payoffs violated the law is for antitrust lawyers to decide, but the fact Google repeatedly thought nothing about ignoring its original founding principles continues to speak pretty loudly either way.

<h3>from the <i>here-we-go-again</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Earlier this week <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210816/06564447367/t-mobile-investigating-100-million-subscriber-data-breach.shtml">reports emerged</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a massive hack of the company's internal systems, resulting in hackers gaining access to a massive trove of consumer information they were selling access to in underground forums. Initial estimates were that the personal details of 100 million customers had been accessed (aka all T-Mobile customers). After maintaining radio silence as it investigated the hack, T-Mobile has since <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Shares-Additional-Information-Regarding-Ongoing-Cyberattack-Investigation/default.aspx">released a statement</a> detailing the scale of the intrusion. In short, it was smaller than initial claims, but still massive and terrible:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Our preliminary analysis is that approximately 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customer accounts’ information appears to be contained in the stolen files, as well as just over 40 million records of former or prospective customers who had previously applied for credit with T-Mobile. Importantly, no phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised in any of these files of customers or prospective customers."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
While T-Mobile notes that none of the PINS used by <em>former</em> or prospective <em>postpaid</em> (billed regularly month to month) customers were accessed, T-Mobile does note that 850,000 <em>active</em> T-Mobile prepaid customers had their names, phone numbers and account PINs exposed. Many others had their social security numbers, drivers license/ID information, and other data exposed:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Some of the data accessed did include customers’ first and last names, date of birth, SSN, and driver’s license/ID information for a subset of current and former postpay customers and prospective T-Mobile customers."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
While it's understood why T-Mobile would collect some of this data during a credit check, it's not clear exactly why it needed to keep this data <b>after</b> the credit check is complete. This, again, is the kind of stuff you could tackle with a basic US privacy law with meaningful penalties for companies that keep getting hacked. For T-Mobile customers I think this is maybe the fifth or sixth time the company has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">hacked since 2018</a>. You have to think clear, basic, and consistently enforced federal guidelines and penalties would incentivize companies to not over-collect data and properly secure their systems.
</p>
<p>
Instead we stand around, shrug, complain that it's <em>impossible</em> or <em>too hard</em> to have competent governance on this subject, and nothing changes. And when consumers then get hacked (again), the best they get are platitudes like "free credit reporting," which prove utterly useless given they've received "free credit reporting" the last 75 times their data wasn't properly secured.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear how many of these kinds of repeated scandals we need to see before the federal government crafts some basic, competent guard rails, but it's abundantly clear that, thanks to a broad cross-industry coalition of lobbyists with near-unlimited budgets, it's not going to be anytime soon.

<h3>from the <i>synergies</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
To gain regulatory approval for its $26 billion merger with Sprint, T-Mobile made numerous promises. One was that the deal would immediately create jobs (there've been <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210423/09130146665/5000-t-mobile-employees-lost-their-jobs-post-merger-while-ex-ceo-john-legere-saw-137-million-golden-parachute.shtml">5,000 layoffs so far</a>). Another was that the company would work closely with Dish Network to help them build a fourth wireless network that would replace Sprint, theoretically "fixing" the reduction in competition the deal created. As <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190729/07261642669/dojs-plan-to-fix-t-mobile-merger-isnt-going-to-work.shtml">predicted</a>, that plan isn't working out well either.
</p>
<p>
Dish and T-Mobile have been fighting like cats and dogs since the deal was finalized. Instead of helping Dish Network grow, T-Mobile has been poaching Dish customers with promotions <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/switch-to-metro-by-t-mobile-get-a-free-5g-phone">specifically targeting Dish</a>. T-Mobile also promised to keep its older 3G, CDMA network operational for Dish to use until 2023 (giving it time to build out its own 5G network), but Dish has been accusing T-Mobile of turning that network off on January 1, 2022, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5g3my/doj-warns-millions-of-boost-mobile-customers-could-lose-service">far earlier than originally promised</a>. Dish argues that millions of its Boost Mobile branded wireless subscribers could lose access to service in the new year.
</p>
<p>
This week California regulators sided with Dish and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/t-mobile-apparently-lied-to-government-to-get-sprint-merger-approval-ruling-says/">effectively accused T-Mobile of lying to gain merger approval</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"T-Mobile's false and misleading statements under oath indicated, among other things, that T-Mobile would make its CDMA network "available to Boost customers until they were migrated to Dish Network Corporation's LTE or 5G services" and that Dish would have up to three years to complete the migration, the ruling said. The CPUC can impose penalties against T-Mobile of up to $100,000 for each offense."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
In short Dish says T-Mobile simply isn't living up to its merger commitments. In turn, a T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/for-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind">blog post</a> effectively accuses Dish is just making everything up, and insists Dish is simply too cheap to give its wireless users discounted 4G and 5G phones to avoid problems when T-Mobile's 3G network shuts down. California regulators, including Administrative Law Judge Karl Bemesderfer and a CPUC commissioner, appear inclined to believe Dish Network based on their review of T-Mobile's pre-merger promises:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Their ruling said there is "a reasonable basis to conclude that T-Mobile... misrepresented material facts and misled the commission" with statements under oath. The ruling said that when the CPUC allowed the merger, it "relied on the specific false statements, omissions, and/or misleading assurances T-Mobile gave regarding its use of [Sprint's] PCS spectrum and its repeated references to a three-year customer migration period without a degraded experience... it appears that these false statements, omissions and/or misleading assurances and the related time references were intended to induce the commission to approve the merger."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Again, simply blocking this deal and finding some <b>other</b> way to prop up Sprint (without eliminating a direct competitor) was always the simpler, cleaner, option. Instead, the Trump DOJ and FCC constructed this elaborate and likely doomed alternative which (ironically for a party with a purportedly "hands off" and "government never works" mindset), involves having government try to nanny a cumbersome arrangement to fruition for the better part of a decade. With Dish consistently losing <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5g3my/doj-warns-millions-of-boost-mobile-customers-could-lose-service">both wireless and TV subscribers</a>, it's not clear Dish will even remain viable enough for that to work.
</p>
<p>
Dish is a company with no experience in wireless, with a history of being cheap and difficult to work with, that has to not only build out a world class 5G network in a few years, but has to make a network so popular with consumers it successfully leeches subscribers from AT&#038;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. And it has to do it without financially imploding as it continues to hemorrhage wireless and TV subscribers. And US regulators, not exactly the model of consistent oversight, would need to hold all companies involved meaningfully accountable should they miss build-out metrics.
</p>
<p>
I still tend to think the entire deal was performative theater providing flimsy justification to approval a deal experts made very clear would reduce competition, raise prices, and harm jobs. It was pushed by folks whose only real interest was reducing competition so the remaining three players could inevitably jack up prices. And while I do think Dish is making a good show of it (because they have to), I still tend to think this could end with Dish selling its trove of valuable spectrum (once deal restrictions end), making tens of billions, then throwing a few peanuts at any flimsy regulatory penalties on their way to the exit.

<h3>from the <i>whoops-a-daisy</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
As Netflix has grown internationally, the company has increased its crackdown on "content tourism," or the act of using a VPN to trick Netflix into letting you watch content specifically licensed for other countries. If you take a look at <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/internet-tv/netflix-international-tv-movies">what's available per country</a>, the motivation to use a VPN to watch content not available in your market becomes abundantly obvious.
</p>
<p>
Pressured by copyright holders concerned about this "piracy," Netflix began beefing up its war on VPNs around 2016. This primarily involved blocking VPN IP addresses used by users trying to avoid this sort of "geofencing."
</p>
<p>
Initially it wasn't particularly difficult for VPN providers to skirt the restrictions. Often by trying to disguise their VPN IP addresses as the IP addresses of normal, residential broadband users. But more recently, Netflix has been beefing up its VPN blocking efforts, including the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-intensifies-vpn-ban-and-targets-residential-ip-addresses-too-210811/">banning of some residential IP addresses</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Netflix doesn’t explain which IP addresses are blocked and why, but the most recent efforts are much broader than before. This issue was brought to our attention by WeVPN, which noticed that the updated geo-fencing system is blocking its residential IP addresses."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that determining which IP address is a VPN disguised as a residential broadband subscriber, and which IP address is an <em>actual residential broadband subscriber</em> is going to prove difficult, inevitably leading to some collateral damage:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The collateral damage is that you have hundreds of thousands of legitimate residential Netflix subscribers blocked from accessing Netflix’s local country full catalog from their home,” a WeVPN spokesperson informs us.
</p>
<p>
While we are unable to verify how many people are facing issues, it is clear that the measures are spilling over to regular subscribers.
</p>

<p>
Torrent Freak points to a growing number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/p26fr6/netflix_glitch/">complaints</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/p1trnt/help_netflix_shows_not_showing_over_but_showing/">Reddit</a> from folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/p1ureb/netflix_switched_all_my_continue_watchings_to/">saying</a> that they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/p0ub9h/netflix_missing_content_fixed/">suddenly can't access content</a> they pay for, and none of them appear to be using a VPN or proxy to disguise their real IP address.

<h3>from the <i>whoops-a-daisy</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Another day, another massive privacy scandal. T-Mobile is purportedly investigating a massive data breach that may have revealed the personal data of more than 100 million subscribers. First <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">reported by Motherboard</a>, the stolen data recently popped up on underground hacker forums, and includes subscriber social security numbers, phone numbers, names, physical addresses, unique IMEI numbers, and driver license information. Motherboard confirmed the data is genuine, and noted that the seller is asking $270,000 for a small subset of the data:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"On the underground forum the seller is asking for 6 bitcoin, around $270,000, for a subset of the data containing 30 million social security numbers and driver licenses. The seller said they are privately selling the rest of the data at the moment."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
For years companies and some policymakers have soothed themselves with the belief that data collection of this scale isn't a big deal because data is "anonymized." But there's been a steady <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190723/08540542637/once-more-with-feeling-anonymized-data-is-not-really-anonymous.shtml">parade of studies</a> showing how it's relatively trivial to identify users with just a small portion of additional data. The more data that's just bouncing around in the wild, the easier it gets. And with a bevy of hacks and leaks like this one, it just gets simpler.

T-Mobile has just around 105 million wireless subscribers, meaning this hack could involve... pretty much all of them. Meanwhile consumers have yet to be informed because T-Mobile has yet to fully confirm the hack even happened, or provide any additional information:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"T-Mobile said in a statement to Motherboard that "We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity. We do not have any additional information to share at this time." T-Mobile repeatedly declined to answer follow-up questions about the scale of the breach."

You know, just another day in a country with no meaningful internet-era privacy protections.

<h3>from the <i>surely-THIS-time-will-be-different</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Last September Verizon announced it would be spending $6.2 billion to buy Tracfone, a prepaid wireless phone provider heavily used by lower income families. Given Verizon's reputation and the US telecom industry's long history of empty pre-merger promises, unions and consumer groups <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210722/09214247222/after-exploiting-covid-broadband-program-verizon-faces-unsurprising-opposition-to-tracfone-merger.shtml">rightfully balked</a>.
</p>
<p>
They warned Verizon's track record indicated this would likely end in the consolidation harming the sector, and many low-income customers inevitably paying more money than ever for wireless service. They also pointed to the fact that Verizon just got busted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210524/06450146859/verizon-forces-users-to-more-expensive-broadband-plans-just-to-get-50-covid-subsidy.shtml">exploiting a Covid broadband relief program</a> to <em>upsell users to more expensive plans</em>. In short, they warned that a company like Verizon probably wouldn't be a particularly good steward of a service that catered predominately to low-income Americans. They were correct.
</p>
<p>
Apparently that was then, and this is now. Unions and several consumer groups appear to now have done a complete 180, announcing they <a href="https://www.axios.com/groups-withdraw-objections-verizon-tracfone-deal-263e58d4-ed50-4ff2-9d7d-01c4acef3c93.html?utm_source=twitter&#038;utm_medium=social&#038;utm_campaign=editorial&#038;utm_content=technology-verizon">now support the deal</a> after Verizon pinky swore it would behave responsibly:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon’s proposed purchase of Tracfone, suggesting that the deal could harm Tracfone’s low-income customer base. But the groups announced Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to the new concessions."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Note that only Benton and Public Knowledge were willing to bend on this. Other consumer groups, like the Open Technology Institute and others, tell me they continue to oppose the deal as currently structured.
</p>
<p>
Verizon lays out the promises in a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-tracfone-formalize-commitments-lifeline-program">press release</a>. In short, they promise to continue offering the FCC's "Lifeline" program to Tracfone subscribers (a measly $9.25 per month subsidy for low-income Americans Verizon has previously attempted to undermine) for at least three years. The company pinky swears it will ensure these users have access to discounted 5G service, and that they'll <em>actively market</em> discounted broadband options (instead of hiding them and making them hard to find and sign up for, something really <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070801/154117.shtml">common in telecom merger promises of this type</a>).
</p>
<p>
The problem, of course, is that this is....Verizon. And this is the United States, where "feckless" doesn't even begin to describe the country's state and federal regulatory attitude when it comes to holding telecom giants accountable.
</p>
<p>
Verizon has a long, long, long parade of promises it hasn't lived up to. The company took billions from Pennsylvania taxpayers in the 90s for fiber networks it then <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140424/06185027014/verizon-knows-youre-sucker-takes-taxpayer-subsidies-broadband-doesnt-deliver-lobbies-to-drop-requirements.shtml">failed to deploy</a>. You can also ask <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170314/04285036912/new-york-city-sues-verizon-fiber-optic-bait-switch.shtml">New York City</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170614/10225537588/verizon-gets-wrist-slap-years-neglecting-broadband-networks-new-jersey-pennsylvania.shtml">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150811/06164631908/verizon-thinks-good-idea-to-mock-new-jersey-taxpayers-after-ripping-them-off-years.shtml">much of the eastern seaboard</a> what Verizon promises are worth. And that's before you get to the U.S. telecom industry's 30 year history of merger promises that, time after time after time, wind up being <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160523/07094134521/millions-annoyed-as-frontier-bungles-acquisition-verizon-customers-across-three-states.shtml">worth absolutely nothing</a>. That this endless wave of mergers has been harmful isn't some errant opinion, it's documented history.
</p>
<p>
The impact of mindless telecom consolidation is everywhere, hugely negative, and generally obvious to the majority of US wireless, broadband, and cable TV subscribers. It has consistently and inevitably resulted in higher prices, worse products, and terrible customer service. And the Verizon Tracfone deal promises to usher forth <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/2021/08/daniel-hanley-federal-communications-commission-must-block-verizons-acquisition-of-tracfone/">a whole lot more of it</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The potential windfall for Verizon is staggering. If this deal were to be approved, the FCC would anoint Verizon as the largest wireless prepaid service operator in the United States and the company would obtain an additional 21 million customers. The merger would also allow Verizon to acquire the fourth-largest wireless company by subscribership in the U.S. The acquisition of TracFone by Verizon will also add $8.1 billion in revenue for Verizon and an additional 90,000 retail locations. Such a position will only continue the wave of consolidation in the cellular service sector and fortify Verizon’s market power as one of the largest wireless communications providers in the country."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
The other assumption here is that Verizon will make a promise, then the FCC will follow up consistently to ensure the company is keeping it. But history isn't kind on that subject, either. Telecom companies generally fail to adhere to promises even if <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150422/04580130746/comcast-merger-chances-stall-as-regulators-realize-comcast-meddled-hulu-management-ignored-nbc-deal-conditions.shtml">they're the ones creating the merger conditions</a>. And years later, assuming underfunded and understaffed U.S. regulators even act in the first place, any penalty for missing deadlines (or outright lying) is usually little more than a light wrist slap. The idea that <b>this</b> deal will somehow be any different is just silly.
</p>
<p>
Verizon's promises <em>aren't actually worth anything</em>, and I'm surprised some consumer groups and unions folded so easily here. Buckling seems to make Biden FCC approval more likely, leading to even greater consolidation. Verizon will either ignore the restrictions and face few real FCC penalties under future industry-cozy administrations (President Scott Baio!) or will simply wait for the three-year limits to expire before finding creative ways to nickel and dime low-income consumers. You can set your watch by it, and this bipartisan sport we play where we pretend otherwise is just <em>wholly bizarre</em>.

<h3>from the <i>tilted-playing-field</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
For years, AT&T worked tirelessly to erode its customers' legal rights, using mouse print in its terms of service preventing consumers from participating in lawsuits against the company. Instead, customers were forced into binding arbitration, where arbitrators, chosen and paid by the companies under fire, unsurprisingly rule in favor of companies <a href="https://www.citizen.org/media/press-releases/mandatory-arbitration-stacks-deck-against-credit-cardholders-data-show">more often than not</a>. Initially, the lower courts derided this anti-consumer behavior for what it was, noting that however brutally flawed the class action is, binding arbitration, at least the way we let companies design it, in many ways made things worse.
</p>
<p>
But these lower court roadblocks quickly evaporated when the Supreme Court ruled in 2011 (Mobility v. Concepcion) that what AT&T was doing was perfectly OK. While lower courts saw this as an "unconscionable" abuse of consumer rights and the law, the Supreme Court bought into the ongoing myth that binding arbitration is a hyper-efficient, modern alternative to class actions. In reality, it shifted things to a form of binding arbitration that was costly, lopsided, and cumbersome for consumers, and less transparent for those used to visiting Pacer to dig up legal histories.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to a few years ago, when a growing number of companies and services (like Fairshake) began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/arbitration-overload.html">streamlining the arbitration process</a>, making it easier and less expensive for consumers (and yeah, class action lawyers). This shifted the balance of power back toward consumers, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-uber/forced-into-arbitration-12500-drivers-claim-uber-wont-pay-fees-to-launch-cases-idUSKBN1O52C6">starting in 2018 or so</a> companies like Uber, AT&T and Comcast began to complain they were being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/arbitration-overload.html">swamped with arbitration feuds</a>.
</p>
<p>
So now we're seeing another sea change. Now, even giants like Amazon are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-faced-75-000-arbitration-demands-now-it-says-fine-sue-us-11622547000?mod=djemalertNEWS">being forced to take consumer complaints back to the courtroom</a>, in part because a system they constructed to dodge accountability is no longer helping them do that.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, company lobbyists are firing up their opposition to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1423/text">Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act</a>, which would (as the name implies) prohibit the practice in several sectors. The bill has already passed the House, and to prevent it from passing in the Senate companies have been busy cultivating <a href="https://prospect.org/power/corporate-lobbyists-seek-grassroots-support-forced-arbitration/">phony "grass roots" (astroturfed) opposition to the bill</a>. That usually involves using some proxy org (in this case the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) to throw money at people to write (or just support) op-eds in papers around the country insisting how wonderful binding arbitration is:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The pro-arbitration op-ed was already written and included in the body of the email. The op-ed calls arbitration “a relatively cheap and fast process” in a “much more relaxed” environment than a courtroom, which “could soon be eliminated if plaintiffs’ lawyers have their way.” The last line makes its objective clear: “Arizona’s workers and consumers can’t afford for Senators Sinema and [Mark] Kelly to allow [the FAIR Act] to happen."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
As with most campaigns of this kind (they're pretty common in telecom), it involves reaching out to credible people to see if they'd willing to sell their principles downstream for some cash:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Late last week, David Chami, an Arizona attorney who specializes in consumer protection, received an email from Drew Johnson, who identified himself as working with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Johnson offered Chami $2,000 if he could get one of his clients to sign their name to an op-ed opposing the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act, a bill in Congress."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
You know you have a sound argument when you have to pay people to support it. There's so much valid disdain against the class action process (which usually provides lawyers a new boat and plaintiffs a $20 gift certificate to Arby's if they're lucky), it's not hard to lean on that to nab support for binding arbitration. But that in and of itself doesn't mean binding arbitration is <em>good</em>.
</p>
<p>
While <em>conceptually</em> the idea of binding arbitration isn't terrible, the way it has been implemented in the United States is an incomprehensible mess. It reduces the chance of a fair hearing of consumer grievances and makes it as annoying as possible for consumers to challenge corporate power. That's why surveys tend to suggest <a href="http://www.takejusticeback.com/sites/default/files/Survey%20on%20Forced%20Arbitration%20February%202019.pdf">broad, bipartisan support</a> for eliminating the practice. Yeah, the traditional class action system is <em>also</em> a hot mess. But replacing it with something less effective and more annoying was never quite the solution many companies pretended it was. And now that awareness of this fact is growing, they're getting a bit nervous.

<h3>from the <i>fail-upward</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
We've noted more than a few times how the AT&#038;T Time Warner and DirecTV mergers were a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210805/07520947306/us-press-softsells-real-scope-atts-merger-incompetence-ensuring-it-will-happen-again.shtml">monumental, historical disaster</a>. AT&#038;T spent $200 billion to acquire both companies thinking it would dominate the video and internet ad space. Instead, the company lost 9 million subscribers in nine years, fired 50,000 employees, closed numerous popular brands (DC's Vertigo imprint, Mad Magazine), and basically stumbled around incompetently for several years before recently spinning off the entire mess for a song.
</p>
<p>
I just got done noting how the US press' <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210805/07520947306/us-press-softsells-real-scope-atts-merger-incompetence-ensuring-it-will-happen-again.shtml">total failure to adequately outline the scope of this mess</a> ensures that the executives, regulators, and various megamerger cheerleaders will never be held accountable for it. That, in turn, all but guarantees it will happen again. And again. And again. America's obsession with "growth for growth's sake" and megamergers is built on the inherent promise that no matter how many times a megadeal results in layoffs, chaos, and no benefits for anyone other than executives and investors, we'll simply refuse to learn <b>anything</b> from the experience.
</p>
<p>
That requires a lot of revisionist history. So, as if on cue, AT&#038;T CFO Pascal Desroches this week complained that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/att-warnermedia-deal-stock-market-credit-hbo-max-1234992549/?curator=MediaREDEF">AT&#038;T didn't get enough credit</a> for turning HBO Max into a successful streaming brand. AT&#038;T was forced to spin off this mess because the doddering telco sucked at running a media company. But Desroches is trying to claim the recent spinoff of its media ventures occurred because <em>AT&#038;T didn't get enough credit for building HBO</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"AT&#038;T CEO John Stankey was “keenly focused on” the company being in the early stages of a “significant evolution in connectivity,” 5G and fiber, with management knowing it needed to invest there and in HBO Max, he told the Oppenheimer Annual Technology, Internet &#038; Communications Conference.
</p>
<p>
“One of the things we realized (was that), even though we were succeeding in our launch of HBO Max, <u>the market wasn’t giving us the appropriate credit for it</u>,” Desroches said.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
This is a weird rewriting of history. Ex-AT&#038;T CEO Randall Stephenson was literally shoved into early retirement because instead of focusing on the company's core competencies (running and building networks; spying on Americans; lobbying the government to hamstring competition), AT&#038;T blew an absolute ocean of money trying to elbow its way into the TV business. But like so many telcos (see: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180629/09023140137/verizons-sad-attempt-to-woo-millennials-falls-flat-face.shtml">Verizon Go90</a>), decades as a pampered government telecom monopoly leaves you ill-suited toward making adequate inroads in creative, competitive industries.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, AT&#038;T's path post-merger was pretty obvious. It had to take the HBO brand, not fuck it up, and shovel it into a functional streaming experience. But the company struggled for the first several years to do that. It released so many conflicting, confusing AT&#038;T and HBO streaming brands that they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190905/07444142926/atts-terrible-new-tv-branding-confuses-even-att.shtml">even managed to confuse their own support employees</a>. Meanwhile, AT&#038;T executives, obsessed with engagement over quality, have taken the HBO brand and watered it down. Now you can see a lot of quality HBO fare like <em>Six Feet Under</em> intermingled with AT&#038;T concepts like "<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alessadominguez/fboy-island-hbo-max-review">Fuckboy Island</a>," which kind of speaks for itself.
</p>
<p>
If you actually talk to any of the creatives at places like DC or HBO (the ones who weren't fired, anyway), they're quick to point out that AT&#038;T brass really <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200811/07375045088/att-fires-hundreds-dc-hbo-execs-latest-example-merger-synergies.shtml">had no idea what they were doing</a>. It was like having an alleyway brawler run an opera house. Telcos aren't good at adaptation, creativity, competition, or innovation, because as government-pampered monopolies, they've never had to be. I'm not sure how many times we have to watch a telco fall on its face in this fashion before that becomes clear to people.
</p>
<p>
The reality is that AT&#038;T screwed up, then had to spin off the entire mess <em>because it screwed up</em>. For AT&#038;T's CFO to suggest the spin off was because the "market didn't give us a cookie" for building HBO Max is some weird, revisionist history. Revisionist history that once again ignores the 50,000 post-merger(s) layoffs, the fact AT&#038;T received billions from government to make all of this work (the $42 billion Trump tax cut, merger approvals, the death of net neutrality), and still somehow screwed it up. There is absolutely no scenario in which any AT&#038;T executive involved in any aspect of this mess gets a cookie.

<h3>from the <i>too-big-to-function</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Back in 2014 when Facebook bought Oculus, there were the usual pre-merger promises that nothing would really change. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, who has since moved on to selling border surveillance tech to the Trump administration, made <a href="https://time.com/38366/here-are-7-promises-oculus-has-made-after-getting-bought-by-facebook/">oodles of promises to that effect</a> after selling the company to Facebook for $2 billion. Facebook itself also promised that users would never be forced to use a Facebook login account just to use your VR headset and its games, and that the company wouldn't track your behavior for advertising.
</p>
<p>
Like every major merger, those promises didn't mean much. Just about a year ago, Facebook and Oculus <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/">announced</a> that users will soon be forced to... use a Facebook account if they want to be able to keep using Oculus hardware, so the company can track its users for advertising purposes.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a year and things have been flipped a bit on their heads.
</p>
<p>
Facebook users who have their accounts hacked and subsequently locked say it's impossible to get anybody at Facebook support to even listen to them. There's no real customer support helpline, and like many places COVID has made customer service staffing harder than ever. There is apparently an online form you can use that requires you provide your driver's license and other data to unlock your account, but Facebook users say it's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023801277/your-facebook-account-was-hacked-getting-help-may-take-weeks-or-299?t=1628075054000">apparently less than useless</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Instead, Facebook tells users to report hacked accounts through its website. The site instructs them to upload a copy of a driver's license or passport to prove their identities. But the people NPR spoke with said they had trouble with every step of this automated process and wish Facebook would offer a way to reach a real person.
"I sent these forms in morning, noon and night, multiple times a day," Marsala said. "Nobody got back to me, not once."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
But if you <em>actually buy something</em> from Facebook they actually at least try to care. So, following in the footsteps of some Reddit users, hacked Facebook users have been buying $300 VR headsets (then often returning them unopened) just to get help:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"I ultimately broke down and bought a $300 Oculus Quest 2," he said...Sherman contacted Oculus with his headset's serial number and heard back right away. He plans to return the unopened device, and while he's glad the strategy worked, he doesn't think it's fair.
</p>
<p>
"The only way you can get any customer service is if you prove that you've actually purchased something from them," he said."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Granted this probably won't work for long. And Facebook recently announced it was <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/customer-support-update-for-quest-2-foam-interface/">halting sales of the Oculus Quest 2 for now</a> because the device's foam face plate was causing skin irritation for some people. Still, it shows that at the scale Facebook operates at, semi-consistent content moderation isn't the only thing the company finds impossible. Basic customer support for people locked out of their accounts at no fault of their own is also too much to ask. Which then again raises the question: if you can't function as a business at the scale Facebook operates, maybe you shouldn't <em>exist</em> at that scale.

For more than a decade we've noted how the US broadband industry's biggest problem is a lack of healthy competition. In countless markets consumers either have the choice of a terrible phone company or a cable giant. The nation's phone companies have spent the last decade <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170808/10281837957/nations-telcos-are-hemorrhaging-customers-because-they-refuse-to-upgrade-their-networks.shtml">refusing to upgrade</a> (or in some cases <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wj3v5n/american-phone-companies-are-literally-letting-their-networks-fall-apart">even repair</a>) their aging DSL lines, because they don't see residential broadband as worth their while.

While that may be great for cable companies, execs, and investors, it's not so great for consumers whose only choice of broadband is aging DSL from an apathetic telco. Instead of upgrading its customers to fiber across more than 20 states, US telco CenturyLink (recently rebranded "Lumen") <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/centurylink-selling-copper-network-in-20-states-instead-of-installing-fiber/">announced</a> it would be selling much of the company's copper DSL and phone network to private equity firm Apollo. Under the $7.5 billion dollar deal CenturyLink will keep the customers it actually cares about, then throw the (mostly rural) customers it doesn't care about at a private equity firm that isn't likely to upgrade them either.
</p>
<p>
Apollo, primarily famous for acquiring old newspapers, lobotomizing them, then stripping them for parts, <a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/08-03-2021-213555724">claims</a> it will upgrade many of these users to fiber. But that doesn't seem particularly likely given their track record, or the track record of similar deals like this, which basically involves shuffling ownership of aging DSL lines <a href="https://potsandpansbyccg.com/2021/08/09/centurylink-selling-copper-assets/">nobody wants to actually upgrade</a>, then milking the assets until the next sale. Many of these customers have been stuck on expensive, slow DSL for the better part of fifteen years as they get shuffled from disinterested owner to disinterested owner:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"It will be interesting to see if Apollo can do better than other past forays with buying copper networks. I can’t think of one of these mega-deals where buying copper networks has gone well. I think back on the purchases by Frontier, Fairpoint, Iowa Telephone, Windstream, Citizens, and others that never panned out – and those deals were for copper that wasn't as ancient as is coming in this sale. Some of the rural customers in this sale have seen the name of the incumbent telco change several times – but they haven’t seen improvements in copper for decades."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
The cycle of apathy is directly responsible for the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3np4a/new-municipal-broadband-map">surging interest in local community and municipal broadband networks</a>, often run by people who actually give two flying shits about the communities they're dealing with. Of course instead of embracing those alternatives as a productive way to shore up overall broadband access (during a plague, no less), many US policymakers have instead <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200515/09354944508/new-study-tries-fails-to-claim-community-broadband-is-inevitable-boondoggle.shtml">demonized</a> and tried to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210217/07093546258/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic.shtml">ban</a> them.

<h3>from the <i>this-is-going-well</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
If you recall, economists <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj">repeatedly warned</a> the $26 billion Sprint/T-Mobile merger would kill jobs, harm competition, and ultimately raise prices for consumers. To "fix" the problem, the Trump DOJ and FCC concocted an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210401/11205746534/trump-doj-fcc-fix-crappy-t-mobile-merger-isnt-looking-so-hot.shtml">elaborate and cumbersome plan</a> to create a replacement fourth wireless carrier out of Dish Network, despite the company's lack of experience in the sector and history of empty promises. So far none of this is going particularly well, with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210301/07003546344/t-mobile-promised-major-job-growth-post-sprint-merger-sec-filings-show-exact-opposite-happened.shtml">5,000 and counting lost jobs</a>, Dish and T-Mobile clearly <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210721/07170647214/government-fix-t-mobile-merger-continues-to-look-like-convoluted-mess.shtml">unable to get along</a>, and Dish... the cornerstone of the entire plan... continuing to bleed both TV and wireless subscribers.
</p>
<p>
Of all the pay TV providers dealing with "cord cutting," Dish has indisputably been hit the hardest, losing <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/dish-networks-earnings-subscribers-1234992528/">another 67,000 pay TV subscribers last quarter</a>. It technically added 65,000 Sling TV streaming video subscribers, but it wasn't enough to offset the 132,000 customers that cancelled Dish's traditional satellite TV service. With absolutely no plans to build new satellites and users shifting increasingly to streaming, Dish knows satellite TV is a dead end.
</p>
<p>
That's where the company's wireless business is supposed to come in.
</p>
<p>
As part of the DOJ/FCC deal, Dish obtained billions in spectrum and the Boost prepaid mobile brand from Sprint. The idea is that Dish is supposed to operate a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) as it builds out its own, full 5G wireless network.
</p>
<p>
But, there too, things aren't going particularly well. Dish lost 201,000 Boost subscribers in the last quarter. And while it added 200,000 subscribers last March by <a href="https://about.dish.com/2021-03-08-DISH-to-acquire-Republic-Wireless">buying a small wireless company named Republic Wireless</a>, a research note by Wall Street analyst Craig Moffett indicates the overall trajectory isn't a great one:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Their Q2 loss of 201K wireless subscribers (about 2.3% of their Q1-ending subscriber base, or almost exactly the size of Republic Wireless) means that <u>they have now organically lost 9.7% of their subscribers in their first year of ownership</u>."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
The Trump DOJ and FCC "fix" for the Sprint T-Mobile merger was always a bit dodgy. It was hand-crafted by a DOJ "antitrust enforcer" in Makan Delrahim who was completely disinterested in data showing the deal should be blocked. Delrahim was far more interested in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html">working as a glorified life coach</a> for Sprint, T-Mobile, and Dish executives looking for regulatory approval. The deal itself always felt like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190729/07261642669/dojs-plan-to-fix-t-mobile-merger-isnt-going-to-work.shtml">flimsy theatrical cover</a> to justify rubber stamping the Sprint T-Mobile deal, instead of a real fix for any genuine problems.
</p>
<p>
Now the whole mess is in the lap of the Biden DOJ, who this week <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001082/000155837021010868/dish-20210630xex99d1.htm">sent a letter to Dish</a> urging Dish and T-Mobile to start getting along. The DOJ is particularly concerned about the fact that T-Mobile's shutdown of its 3G CDMA network could leave millions of Boost mobile customers stranded January 1. Dish says the shutdown was earlier than promised, violating merger guidelines. T-Mobile says Dish is simply being too cheap to give Boost users discounted 4G or 5G phones. Either way, the DOJ isn't impressed:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"After careful consideration of the Parties’ submissions and arguments, the Division is left with grave concerns about the potential for a nationwide CDMA shutdown to leave a substantial proportion of Boost’s customers without service. While it cannot reach any conclusions today regarding events that have not yet transpired, the Division believes that the Final Judgment may be violated by one or both Parties if the network shutdown strands a substantial proportion of Boost customers, particularly if either or both Parties have not taken all appropriate steps to affirmatively alleviate any such harms in the leadup to implementing the network shutdown. If that situation manifests—and we sincerely hope that it does not—the Division may act pursuant to its authority under the Final Judgment or seek relief from the Court against one or both Defendants."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
But again, the real problem is this deal was always a stupid, unworkable mess from the get go. Numerous experts noted so, and they were all ignored. Largely because the deal provided useful if flimsy cover for merger approval, which is all that really mattered.
</p>
<p>
To make any of this work Dish, a company with no real experience in the sector it's trying to disrupt, needs to remain financially viable as it attempts to meet guidelines attached to its deal with the DOJ and FCC (providing wireless to 70% of the country by 2025). But Dish is a company with a long history of empty promises in wireless (just ask <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-takes-huge-swing-at-dish-for-hoarding-spectrum">T-Mobile circa 2018</a>), run by a guy (Charlie Ergen) people traditionally say is hard to work both for and <em>with</em>, purportedly building a new wireless network whose details remain hard to come by.
</p>
<p>
l still tend to think it seems entirely possible Dish strings feckless U.S. regulators along for years then, once the six year restriction on selling its spectrum expires, cashes out, hoovers up billions of dollars, then throws a relative pittance at any remaining legal or regulatory penalties. The U.S. wireless sector gets even more consolidated, and all the folks who pushed this dodgy fix for a bad deal (that should have been rejected outright) simply forget any of this ever happened.

<h3>from the <i>not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-whimper</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Under former CEO Randall Stephenson, AT&#038;T spent nearly $200 billion on mergers with DirecTV and Time Warner, hoping this would secure its ability to dominate the pay TV space through brute force. But the exact opposite happened. Saddled with so much debt from the deal, AT&#038;T passed on annoying <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180702/09332640153/fresh-off-merger-att-jacks-up-price-streaming-video-service.shtml">price hikes</a> to its consumers. It also embraced a branding strategy so damn confusing -- with so many different product names -- it even <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190905/07444142926/atts-terrible-new-tv-branding-confuses-even-att.shtml">confused its own employees</a>.
</p>
<p>
All told, AT&#038;T lost 9.5 million customers in just over four years. Not exactly the kind of "domination" the company envisioned. Meanwhile, employees also paid the price. Despite billions in regulatory favors (killing net neutrality and broadband privacy rules) and a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191211/10503943556/att-said-trump-tax-cuts-would-create-thousands-jobs-instead-atts-laying-off-thousands.shtml">$42 billion tax break from the Trump administration</a> for literally <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200616/14541444731/att-has-now-eliminated-41000-jobs-since-42-billion-trump-tax-cut.shtml">doing less than nothing</a>, AT&#038;T has also laid off more than 50,000 employees since 2017. The company also took an axe to several well-loved brands (Mad Magazine, DC's Vertigo Comic imprint) as its executives crashed and bounced their way around unfamiliar businesses.
</p>
<p>
Last week AT&#038;T finally completed its spinoff of DirecTV. Kind of a sad little whimper to the company's original vision. Yet somehow, much of the sterile news coverage of the whole mess doesn't capture the real scale or scope of the failure.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/att-completes-spinoff-of-its-shrinking-directv-unit/">New York Post</a>, for example, can't be bothered to mention a single layoff or a cite a single AT&#038;T misstep. The same thing over at <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/directv-completes-spinoff-from-at-t-will-turn-at-t-tv-into-directv-stream/">CNET</a>, where the final chapter in AT&#038;T's ugly saga is framed in this detached, oddly clinical way, completely avoiding pointing out AT&#038;T incompetence or the human wreckage these deals left behind. This is how spending $200 billion on mergers that resulted in massive layoffs and utter organizational chaos is described by the outlet:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The DirecTV transaction is just one of two major media shake-ups at AT&#038;T, which is in the process of restructuring itself after spending billions of dollars acquiring media companies in recent years."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
This is kind of the status quo in American megamerger business coverage. Many major outlets are simply <em>terrified</em> of offending advertisers or sources at these companies. So they'll happily parrot most pre-merger promises of "synergies," but when things go south (as they usually do in mindless telecom and media consolidation) they just... don't mention the real world human impact at all, then hope nobody notices. I tend to notice having covered telecom and media for 20 years, and witnessed more bungled, regulator rubber stamped megadeals than I care to remember.
</p>
<p>
A little side irony: the hundreds of billions of dollars (often taxpayer subsidized) AT&#038;T and Verizon repeatedly throw at bungled mergers and doomed projects (crappy app stores, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180629/09023140137/verizons-sad-attempt-to-woo-millennials-falls-flat-face.shtml">Go90</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/isis-mobile-wallet-rebrands-to-softcard-to-distance-from-miltant-terror-group/">mobile payment platforms with the same names as terrorist organizations</a>, news outlets that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141028/17160228974/verizon-launches-tech-news-blog-that-bans-any-articles-about-net-neutrality-government-surveillance.shtml">ban reporters from talking about important things</a>) could have funded fiber to every home in America (a consistent, massive revenue source) several times over. That just gets forgotten as Congress bickers over whether <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210524/11173946864/biden-cuts-35-billion-new-broadband-plan-to-appease-gop.shtml">$65 billion in broadband investment is wasteful</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course the press isn't the only one who will rabbit hole AT&#038;T's failures. The regulators, politicians, judges, pundits, and think tankers that cheered on these deals will pretend none of this ever happened, and will never have to reckon with the real world harm of mindless consolidation and a "growth for growth's sake" mindset. In part because the US press generally won't require them to. If journalism is really about <em>clearly explaining the truth to people</em>, avoiding essential context because it <em>might make your event donors, advertisers, and sources mad</em> is... not that.

<h3>from the <i>giant-wheel-of-dysfunction</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
Three years ago a US Senate Committee <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-06-25%20PSI%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Federal%20Cybersecurity%20Updated.pdf">report</a> showcased that the U.S. government's cybersecurity defenses were the IT equivalent of damp cardboard. The study found numerous government agencies were using dated systems that were expensive to maintain but hard to properly secure. It also noted how from 2008 to 2018, the government repeatedly failed to adequately protect sensitive data at the Social Security Administration and Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Education.
</p>
<p>
Three years have gone by and guess what: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/08/the-state-department-and-3-other-us-agencies-earn-a-d-for-cybersecurity/">very little has actually changed</a>. The latest <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Cybersecurity%20-%20America's%20Data%20Still%20at%20Risk%20(FINAL).pdf">47 page report</a> (pdf) found that little meaningful improvement was made in the last three years, with cybersecurity at those same eight federal agencies earning four grades of D, three Cs, and a single B:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"It is clear that the data entrusted to these eight key agencies remains at risk. As hackers, both state-sponsored and otherwise, become increasingly sophisticated and persistent, Congress and the executive branch cannot continue to allow PII and national security secrets to remain vulnerable."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
This report is just one of countless instances over the last two decades where the government was warned that it's expensive, shitty, dated systems <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131204/13012925456/advisory-panel-offers-suggestions-to-strengthen-us-cybersecurity-is-government-capable-change.shtml">simply weren't secure</a>. In this report, of the eight agencies, only the DHS showed meaningful improvements in IT security:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"What this report finds is stark. Inspectors general identified many of the same issues that have plagued Federal agencies for more than a decade. <u>Seven agencies made minimal improvements</u>, and only DHS managed to employ an effective cybersecurity regime for 2020. As such, <u>this report finds that these seven Federal agencies still have not met the basic cybersecurity standards necessary to protect America’s sensitive data</u>."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Much like election security, there's a lot of bloviation and consultant bucks that get thrown around -- often with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180801/16445640350/election-security-has-become-partisan-issue-as-senate-votes-down-funding.shtml">little to show for it</a>. DC lawmakers often talk a lot about the importance of cybersecurity, but only as so far as it pertains to being helpful in terms of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200603/10325944638/senator-cotton-dumbly-claims-huawei-building-5g-networks-is-like-letting-ussr-build-us-cold-war-submarines.shtml">partisan fear mongering</a>, lining the pockets of campaign contributors, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnan/bombshell-report-finds-phone-network-encryption-was-deliberately-weakened">weakening encryption for their own surveillance purposes</a>, or <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210608/07113246949/former-fcc-boss-wheeler-says-trump-fcc-napped-cybersecurity.shtml">protecting the interests of dominant domestic corporations</a>. But when it comes to taking actual, intelligent, meaningful action (like oh, shoring up the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180604/07134939961/yet-another-study-shows-internet-things-is-privacy-security-dumpster-fire.shtml">security nightmare that is the internet of broken things</a>), we fail repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
The report of course comes about seven months after Russian government sponsored hackers used a massive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">supply chain attack</a> to gain access to systems at numerous US government agencies and over 100 corporations. And just four months after Chinese government sponsored hackers breached multiple federal agencies by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Pulse Secure VPN. While both events have taken the usual DC consternation, hand wringing, and big dollar consultant payouts in to new levels, who the hell knows if any of it leads to actual, meaningful reform.

<h3>from the <i>what-could-possibly-go-wrong</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
We've noted more times than I can count how in the modern era, you no longer really own the things you buy. Thanks to internet connectivity, hardware you own can be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160404/12394434100/you-dont-actually-own-what-you-buy-volume-2203-google-bricking-revolv-smart-home-hardware.shtml?op=sharethis">bricked</a> or downgraded to the point where you lose essential features. Or, just as often, obnoxious DRM means you have to jump through all kinds of bizarre hoops to <em>actually use</em> the thing you thought you owned, whether that's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150508/06582730934/keurig-ceo-sort-apologizes-companys-ridiculous-foray-into-obnoxious-coffee-drm.shtml">Keurig using DRM</a> to prevent you from using competing coffee pods, to printer manufacturers using DRM to keep you from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170914/11491238210/hp-brings-back-obnoxious-drm-that-cripples-competing-printer-cartridges.shtml">buying cheaper cartridges</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now Home Depot is experimenting further with DRM at the point of sale. The company has started embedding chips in many of the major tool brands it sells (DeWalt, Milwaukee). And unless the tool is enabled by a Bluetooth-based system at the register, it <a href="https://mycbs4.com/news/local/home-depot-to-use-bluetooth-technology-to-stop-theft">simply won't work when you take it home</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Home Depot says their new anti-theft strategy is now being used in several stores nationwide to combat the thefts of their most popular power tools. A chip is inserted into power tools of major brands like DeWalt and Milwaukee brand tools, similar to how gift cards need to be scanned and paid for at a store to activate. Once the tools are paid for, the store will use Bluetooth technology to activate the tool."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Yes, what could possibly go wrong. What if the system is buggy and doesn't work? What if you then try to contact a manufacturer or retailer that no longer exists or supports the device and systems in question? Too bad.
</p>
<p>
The company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/home-depot-fights-shoplifters-special-power-tools-2021-7">tells Business Insider</a> the program isn't focused on individual shoplifting, but wholesale efforts by organized crime to steal power tools in bulk. But given the sophistication of organized crime, and the overall vulnerability of Bluetooth tech, the risk here is not insubstantial that criminals find a way to circumnavigate this technology rendering it useless:
</p>
<div class="centered">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en">Just what nobody asked for: DRM but for power tools. I wonder how long it will take for someone to bypass it. <a href="https://t.co/RpnxOzl3KY">pic.twitter.com/RpnxOzl3KY</a>

Then you're simply left with an additional layer of cumbersome technical restrictions that potentially risk making tool purchase and ownership more of a hassle. People act as if they'd never read Cory Doctorow.

Late last year consumer group Free Press released a report showing how numerous broadband providers had been gaming the FCC's RDOF (Rural Digital Opportunity Fund) subsidy program <a href="https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/insights-opinions/fiber-clubhouse-pai-subsidizes-broadband-rich">to get money they didn't really deserve</a>. The program doles out roughly $9.2 billion in subsidies paid for by money paid by consumers into the Universal Service Fund (USF). The study clearly showed that during the last RDOF auction a long list of ISPs gamed the system to gain millions in subsidies to deliver broadband to areas that didn't make any coherent sense.
</p>

<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210615/09130146993/fcc-gives-isp-8000-to-deliver-broadband-five-feet-apples-5-billion-campus.shtml">This ISP</a>, for example, nabbed millions of dollars to deploy service to places that already had it -- like five feet outside of Apple's $5 billion new campus. Elon Musk's Starlink also managed to nab $886 million in subsidies to deploy broadband service to <a href="https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/insights-opinions/space-x-broadband-coming-empty-traffic-island-near-you">places like airport parking lots and traffic medians.</a>
</p>
<p>
The whole mess was just <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201210/07280945859/consumer-groups-say-fcc-just-blew-9-billion-to-deliver-broadband-to-already-served-rich-people.shtml">completely ignored</a> by previous FCC Boss Ajit "what broadband competition problem" Pai. After months of withering criticism from <a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1050650786049/FINAL%20CCA%20Ex%20Parte%20%26%20White%20Paper%20-%2005.06.2021%20(clean).pdf">numerous fronts</a>, the FCC under interim boss Jessica Rosenworcel has stepped up and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595004/fcc-spacex-rural-broadband-rdof-parking-lots-airports?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">fired off letters to several of the worst offenders</a>, giving them a second chance to apply for funding with proposals that actually serve the public interest:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"The Federal Communications Commission told SpaceX and other companies on Monday that the billions in rural broadband subsidies it doled out last year can’t be used in already connected areas like “parking lots and well-served urban areas,” citing complaints. The commission, in an effort to “clean up” its subsidy auction program, offered the companies a chance to rescind their funding requests from areas that already have service."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Granted the problems with the RDOF subsidy process is just one small part of a <b>much</b> bigger problem. For years the government has doled out billions of dollars to telecom giants for fiber networks they then <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200127/09334443804/look-more-giant-isps-taking-taxpayer-money-unfinished-networks.shtml">routinely half deploy</a>. Inaccurate maps and availability data then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition">mar the process further</a>, obscuring not only the lack of access (up to 42 million Americans still can't access broadband) but the way a lack of overall competition harms consumers and raises rates (83 million Americans live under a broadband monopoly).
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171017/10292938419/big-isps-lobby-to-kill-attempts-more-accurate-broadband-mapping.shtml">immense political influence</a> giant telecom providers have over Congress and regulators, efforts to improve the entire mess comes glacially, when they come at all. That's not to ignore the huge benefit subsidies can have on less affluent and disconnected areas of the country when applied correctly, but, for decades now, regional monopolies have dictated US telecom policy. And the result has generally what you'd expect: namely billions in pointless <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200616/14541444731/att-has-now-eliminated-41000-jobs-since-42-billion-trump-tax-cut.shtml">tax breaks</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201005/06582445442/mississippi-says-att-took-283-million-network-it-never-fully-deployed.shtml">subsidies</a> thrown at companies like AT&#038;T in exchange for layoffs, pipe dreams, and perpetually half completed networks.

<h1><a href="/articles/20210803/07260247296/despite-20-years-experience-comcast-nbc-still-sucks-olympics-coverage.shtml">Despite 20 Years Of Experience, Comcast/NBC Still Sucks At Olympics Coverage</a></h1>
<h3>from the <i>fourth-circle-of-hell</i> dept</h3>
<p><p>
NBC (now Comcast NBC Universal) has enjoyed the rights to broadcast the US Olympics since 1998. In 2011, the company paid $4.4 billion for exclusive US broadcast rights to air the Olympics through 2020. In 2014, Comcast NBC Universal shelled out another $7.75 billion for the rights to broadcast the summer and winter Olympics in the US... until the year 2032. Despite years of practice, we've repeatedly noted how the company has done a consistently terrible job at its core responsibility as the holder of those rights: namely, showing people things they actually want to see in a way that isn't annoying.
</p>
<p>
For years Comcast has been criticized for refusing to air events live, spoiling some events, implementing annoying cable paywall restrictions, implementing <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160808/04583435176/comcast-nbc-ignores-lessons-cord-cutting-age-buries-olympics-under-ocean-annoying-advertising.shtml">heavy handed and generally terrible advertising</a>, often <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2014/02/nbc-olympics-the-network-s-coverage-of-the-sochi-games-is-reality-tv-masquerading-as-a-sporting-event.html">sensationalizing coverage</a>, avoiding controversial subjects during broadcasts, and streaming efforts that have ranged from clumsy to outright incompetent.
</p>
<p>
You'd think after 20+ years of criticism Comcast NBC would be doing a better job. Then again, if you <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100401/1448098836.shtml">know Comcast NBC at all</a>, the fact that they <b>aren't</b> (and have been historically <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100401/1448098836.shtml">completely oblivious to that fact</a>) probably isn't all that surprising. And of course this year is no different.
</p>
<p>
While the internet and streaming have allowed Comcast/NBC to offer overall <b>more</b> content to viewers, the way it's being presented continues to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/02/nbc-olympic-coverage-peacock-replays-primetime">scattershot as hell</a>. The company's coverage jumps from event to event in a head-jerking manner, failing to present much of a cohesive narrative from hour to hour:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"...instead of sticking with single events throughout primetime – introducing them, highlighting the stakes and the protagonists, getting the viewer comfortable with the quirks of competition – NBC has deployed this vast arsenal of broadcast resources to spray America’s households with a kind of inescapable Olympic televisual vomit.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
A meaningful tip of the hat to the editor that let "televisual vomit" show up in the pages of <em>The Guardian</em>. And the chaos comes <em>despite</em> the fact that Olympics planners in Tokyo have increasingly tried to schedule events to make them more coherent to audiences in different time zones, especially the west:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"NBC’s programming choices have been consistently bizarre, even more so when you consider that whole chunks of the schedule in Tokyo – for swimming above all, but also in the athletics – were specifically rejigged to cater to the American TV audience, and at several points it’s been unclear to all but the most obsessive Olympics watchers whether what’s on TV at night in the US is live or a replay."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Spend a few moments over at Reddit and you can also find just a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/ols3g8/the_nbc_and_other_broadcasters_official_complaint/">general and profound audience confusion</a> in terms of when things will be broadcast, how and where you can watch event follow ups, and what the hell is going on. And while Comcast having its own streaming app (Peacock) should ideally make things better, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/peacock-olympics-nbc-why-so-bad.html">that doesn't seem to be the case either</a>. Promises of "free coverage" (with ads) via the app haven't been fulfilled because this is Comcast, and Comcast wants to use the opportunity to upsell you to either a streaming subscription or a traditional cable TV subscription if you want to see anything other than celebrity quips:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Peacock will broadcast the team gymnastics finals for both men and women for free, but to watch any of the men’s basketball coverage you must upgrade to Peacock Premium—which costs $4.99 a month (unless, again, you already have Xfinity Internet or a cable subscription). It’s another $5 to get rid of ads."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Like most things Comcast/NBC does (see: broadband), it still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/comcast-nbc-olympics-peacock.html">expects to make a profit off of the Olympics</a> thanks to ads, partnerships, viewer tracking data, and sponsored deals. This despite a lack of competence, Peacock itself being a money loser, sagging traditional cable subscriptions, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/bad-luck-tokyo-olympics-tv-ratings-streaming-profit-nbc-universal-jeff-shell-1234802186/">dipping ratings</a>. Which is why complaints about Comcast/NBC Olympics coverage are more Sisyphean than productive, and we'll all be back here complaining again in a few years.

<div class="cbody"><p> I think often about Verizon's largely successful efforts to modify wireless user packets to track users around the internet, and how they saw really no serious problem with implementing such a system--not only without telling the public it was being implemented, but without providing a working opt-out mechanism. </p>
<p>Even now, after the FCC fine, I believe some variant of that same system remains in play across the AOL/Yahoo ad ecosystem, just with a slightly more verbose amount of fine print, and an opt-out tool that actually works.</p>
<p>And wow, I'd also forgotten about NebuAd. So many scandals, so few substantive reforms or meaningful solutions in the last decade.</p>

<div class="cbody"><p> Privacy is one of those subjects where I genuinely understand, and agree with, the concerns of all involved. </p>
<p>As Ernesto and a few others noted, trust has simply been demolished after years of bad faith arguments, trojan horse bills, and outright falsehoods from the private sector. Compounded by a government that has routinely violated privacy itself, turned a blind eye to privacy violations by others, or shown it's too corrupt or incompetent to tackle the mammoth task before it. </p>
<p>So I get the skepticism...both from those worried that Congress lacks the competence to craft meaningful legislation without causing even more harm...to those who don't want the worst players having an outsized impact in the crafting of said legislation. </p>
<p>In comes a crisis where good faith consensus is needed, and it's seemingly impossible to achieve. I simply have no idea how you even begin restoring that trust. Especially at a time when so many other important problems are going to take priority and resources away from quality privacy proposals.</p>

<div class="cbody"><p> I agree with much of this. So much of this seems to stem from the fact that smaller stakeholders, much like consumers, frequently aren't given a seat at the table because they're incapable of buying influence. </p>
<p>Also as Mike hints at, there's a lot of bad actors (see: AT&amp;T) that are often atrocious on privacy (see: location data scandals) that are now pushing for flimsy federal laws designed to LOOK like they're addressing the problem(s), but are actually focused on pre-empting tougher state or federal consensus-driven solutions. </p>
<p>So yeah, with AT&amp;T having outsized influence in Congress, calls for &quot;one set of strong, sensible, and straightforward privacy protections&quot; usually ends with AT&amp;T lawyers writing half the legislation, especially in this particular Congress.</p>

<div class="cbody"><p> I think some of the disconnect here is driven by the fact that elecom providers, historically, are fused tightly to the law enforcement and intelligence gathering communities. It is, after all, fairly hard at this point to see where AT&amp;T begins and the NSA ends, given AT&amp;T has built dedicated systems geared toward surveillance data collection and have even acted as intelligence agencies time and again. </p>
<p>I'm curious if telecoms almost being PART of government accounts for the fact they are often above reproach by many in DC? These location data scandals were monumentally terrible, with location data access abused by everyone. Including law enforcement, folks pretending to be law enforcement, and stalkers.</p>
<p>Verizon literally thought it was a good idea to modify wireless user data packets to track users around the internet without telling them (the &quot;zombie cookie scandal&quot;), yet the outrage from DC policymakers is always muted in contrast to the coverage we've seen regarding big tech. </p>
<p>Folks like Hawley, for example, can go on at great length about smaller scale privacy scandals out of Silicon Valley, yet very rarely (quite possibly never?) criticizes &quot;big telecom.&quot;</p>
<p>Seems myopic and dangerous to not have a broader, bird's eye view as we debate what privacy laws should look like. </p>
<p>But I'm curious: what are the other reasons for the disconnect here?</p>

<p>Sprint's eminent doom is overplayed for effect by those pushing this shitty deal. They've still got debt problems but have dramatically improved their finances in recent quarters. They're also owned by one of the wealthiest companies in Japan.</p>
<p>And there's a universe of ways to fix Sprint that don't involve merging with a direct competitor in a deal every single economic predictive metric suggests will be terrible. It could merge with Comcast. Or Charter. Or Dish in a deal that doesn't integrate T-Mobile. Or hire better executives. </p>
<p>I have no idea why this guy is so personally upset that I simply pointed to factual reality and the 40 year history of deals like this being terrible for consumers, competitors, and the market.</p>

<div class="cbody">There's certainly plenty of good think tanks. And Copia is an effort to bring a little bit of sanity and more honest discourse to a think tank segment that has, over the years, simply mutated into a way for giant legacy companies to farm bogus science justifying anti-competitive (or anti-environment, etc.) positions.<br /><br />I'm not saying all think tanks are bad.

<div class="cbody">This "bias" claim makes no coherent sense. Comcast is rated, consistently, as one of the worst companies in ANY INDUSTRY IN AMERICA when it comes to customer service and support. Worse than the IRS.<br /><br />Polls indicate the majority of consumers do support net neutrality protections. And surveys indicate they do realize Comcast is an anti-competitive ass.

<div class="cbody">Yeah the fact they didn't reach out directly to FTTF suggests they may have just been bullshitting news outlets to avoid being singled out as apathetic (if not outright hostile) to the concept. We'll see Wednesday, I guess.

<div class="cbody">He's clearly trying to make inroads in flyover country for one reason or another, possibly political. But so few people can actually tell you what net neutrality even is, I doubt it's much of an impediment to whatever his ambitions are. <br /> <br /> And it's not like they admit they oppose net neutrality. Most of the time they claim to support it while actively undermining it, something people not in tune to the recent "Free Basics" shit show over in India probably aren't aware of.

<div class="cbody">This narrative that "blind deregulation magically fixes everything" (including established predatory monopolies) is already shallow and simplistic to begin with, but when people try to apply it to the telecom sector it's just a red flag that they don't know how this particular sector works, or its history.

<div class="cbody">Yes it's clear we don't currently believe in accountability. Pai does clearly have grander political ambitions, and with both privacy and net neutrality not being as partisan as he thinks in his own head, it's possible accountability lies in wait for him somewhere down the road. <br /> <br /> "The guy that killed net neutrality" -- when net neutrality has pretty broad, bipartisan support -- isn't going to be a good look longer term.

<div class="cbody">"What does Net Neutrality have to do with the cable monopolies?" <br /> <br /> Cable's growing monopoly over the last mile means less competition. Less competition means more attempts to creatively abuse this lack of competition, which is what net neutrality infractions are.<br /><br />"Those are driven by local governments and deals between cable companies, none of this will change."<br /><br />Most local franchises are now state level franchises. And blindly deregulating a captive, uncompetitive market doesn't magically fix any of this. Sensible, reasonable government policies to improve competition do. But because the local, state, and federal government is blindly loyal to campaign contributions to a grotesque degree, you're right in the fact that change doesn't happen until other problems are fixed.<br /><br />"It seems to be the case that Title II creates more monopolies by making it harder for new ISPs to compete with established ISPs who already have the market locked down."<br /><br />Says who? I've written about this industry for 20 years and see nothing to support that. <br /> <br /> "Since they all must offer the exact same service under Net Neutrality where is the competition besides speed/price?"<br /><br />Who says they have to offer the exact same service? This also isn't supported. There's a million ways to compete when the playing field is even.<br /><br />"New ISPs will not have this luxury and must develop their infrastructure under far more strict rules."<br /><br />The rules don't restrict upstart ISPs in the slightest. And as we note about three times a week, the idea that Title II stifled investment is an unsupported canard. That's a load of nonsense being pushed by telecom sector folks that want zero accountability as they abuse captive markets.

While immediate tensions have eased, recent developments offer lessons that reflect, and will influence, a deteriorating relationship.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA wide range of contentious issues has been on display. First, Russia\u0026rsquo;s biggest military build-up since 2014 highlighted its capacity to mobilise significant force on Europe\u0026rsquo;s border. This stoked deep concern, and a flurry of diplomacy, in the European Union and NATO.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSecond, revelations that Russian intelligence officers were responsible for a fatal explosion at a Czech arms depot in 2014 drew renewed attention to Russian espionage and subversion. The fact that two of the operatives had later carried out the 2018 Salisbury nerve agent attack amplified concerns. In response, several EU member states have expelled Russian intelligence officers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThird, the human-rights situation in Russia became bleaker. Imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose welfare Western leaders have raised with President Vladimir Putin, went on hunger strike. He ended it 24 days later when close to death. The authorities have dismantled the Anti-Corruption Foundation he built up over the previous decade by declaring it an \u0026lsquo;extremist\u0026rsquo; organisation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFourth, Russia\u0026rsquo;s internal security organisation, the FSB, claimed to have averted a Western-supported attempt on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko\u0026rsquo;s life (though, bizarrely, this \u0026lsquo;coloured revolution\u0026rsquo; was supposedly planned by unnamed \u0026lsquo;opposition-minded generals\u0026rsquo;).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRelations are now at their most tense and mistrustful for four decades. Russia and the US have recalled their respective ambassadors \u0026ndash; the US after strong Russian pressure to do so. Yet despite these difficulties, President Joe Biden invited his Russian counterpart to a bilateral summit. Putin also took part in Biden\u0026rsquo;s climate summit on 22 April, at the height of concerns about Russia\u0026rsquo;s military build-up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eUnwelcome display of Western unity\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThree lessons can be drawn from this intense period. First, Putin lost more than he gained from the military build-up. Although Russia has gained practice in mobilisation, and could yet enhance its position by keeping equipment in place, it has suffered a diplomatic setback. Overall, the West has responded to this test of its resolve by demonstrating strength rather than weakness and division. This first near-crisis is a formative experience for the Biden administration. While few had expected a \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.iiss.org/blogs/analysis/2020/10/russeurasia---biden-and-russia\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003ebetter relationship\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e with Russia, any case for pursuing it appears weaker than ever. And though some \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://cepa.org/putins-game-what-just-happened/\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003eargue\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e that Russia\u0026rsquo;s build-up exposed Ukraine\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability (despite President Volodymyr Zelensky\u0026rsquo;s defiant stand), the other side of this coin is that the US is sensitised to the threat and will plan accordingly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEurope, too, stiffened its resolve despite a campaign of \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.iiss.org/blogs/analysis/2021/04/russia-eu\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRussian pressure\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e. Following an initial joint statement by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron calling on both Ukraine and Russia to de-escalate, private messages were firmer. In particular, on 8 April Merkel \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/telefonat-von-bundeskanzlerin-merkel-mit-dem-russischen-praesidenten-putin-1886540\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003espoke\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e to Putin and called for him to withdraw Russian troops. In the most forceful speech about Russia ever made by an EU High Representative, on 28 April Josep Borrell \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html?mode=chapter\u0026amp;vodLanguage=EN\u0026amp;vodId=13e6d9d8-35b1-37f3-ca00-9dc77208c0b5\u0026amp;date=20210428\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003econdemned\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e a range of Russian actions, including its \u0026lsquo;provocation\u0026rsquo; of Ukraine. Russia was \u0026lsquo;choosing to deliberately deepen confrontation\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;seems to have decided to act as an adversary\u0026rsquo;. The EU \u0026lsquo;must be prepared for a long hard period in our relations\u0026rsquo;. Apart from a brief mention of climate change, there was no hint of cooperation, let alone compromise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRussia\u0026rsquo;s actions also damaged its volatile relationship with Turkey. On 10 April, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-erdogan-voices-support-for-ukraine-amid-crisis/a-57157898\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003ereaffirmed\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e his country\u0026rsquo;s support for Ukraine\u0026rsquo;s territorial integrity during a visit by Zelensky. Immediately after, Russia \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/russia-suspends-most-air-travel-with-turkey-until-june-1\u0022\u003e\u003cspan\u003esuspended\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e most air travel to Turkey, predictably hitting its economy by cutting off tourist revenue. It last did so after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter in 2015.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second lesson is the unfolding contest between local Russian military, and global US financial, superiority. On 15 April, the US imposed new sanctions on Russian individuals, entities and debt in response to Russia\u0026rsquo;s SolarWinds cyber hack and 2020 \u003cspan style=\u0022color: black;\u0022\u003eelection interference.

Opinions are divided on whether Russia was merely sabre-rattling or planned to escalate its intervention in Ukraine. But this is a false distinction. A large (not merely token) force that demonstrates strength can also use it. Sabres that are rattled may be drawn. Force deployment can serve many possible purposes simultaneously, with the choices between them shifting with political opportunity and circumstance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are hints that Russia may have kept open the possibility of escalating force until a late stage of its build-up.

Since the Federation Council\u0026rsquo;s special powers include approval of border changes, use of military force and a state of emergency, this provoked speculation that Putin was laying the ground for a dramatic move in Ukraine. In the end, Putin spoke largely about domestic, not foreign, policy. But he issued a defiant warning that Russia\u0026rsquo;s response to any crossing of its red lines would be \u0026lsquo;asymmetric, rapid and harsh\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOnly Putin knows his intentions.
